What is annoying about the API?
- You don't know what sag_id a Sag has, from reading the ft.dk
- It is tricky to know all the data that is required to recreate a full Sag as you see it on folketinget.dk
- It is not intuitive what Periode is and which one to use.
- Make it easy to get look up tables.
