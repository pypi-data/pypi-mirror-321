# TOPSIS CLI Tool
<i>TOPSIS</i> (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a multi-criteria decision-making method that helps evaluate and rank options based on their relative closeness to an ideal solution. This CLI tool provides a simple and efficient way to perform TOPSIS analysis directly from the command line.

## Features
Supports weighted and impact-based decision-making.
Reads input data from a CSV file.
Outputs ranked results with scores in an easy-to-read CSV format.
Lightweight and user-friendly command-line interface.

## Installation
### Install the package using pip:
```
pip install topsis-cli
```
## Usage
Run the CLI tool with the following syntax:
```
topsis <input_file> <weights> <impacts> <output_file>
```
input_file: Path to the input CSV file containing decision matrix.

weights: Comma-separated list of weights for each criterion (e.g., 0.4,0.3,0.2,0.1).

impacts: Comma-separated list of impacts for each criterion, either + (positive) or - (negative) (e.g., +,+,-,+).

output_file: Path to save the output CSV file with scores and ranks.

### Example
Input File (data.csv):
```
Name	Criterion 1	Criterion 2	Criterion 3	Criterion 4
Option A	250	16	12	5
Option B	200	18	8	3
Option C	300	14	10	4
Option D	275	15	9	2
```
Command:
```
topsis data.csv 0.4,0.3,0.2,0.1 +,+,-,+ results.csv
```
Output File (results.csv):
```
Name	Criterion 1	Criterion 2	Criterion 3	Criterion 4	Score	Rank
Option A	250	16	12	5	0.75	2
Option B	200	18	8	3	0.50	4
Option C	300	14	10	4	0.80	1
Option D	275	15	9	2	0.65	3
```
