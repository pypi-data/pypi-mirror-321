# Speech Engine

Speech Engine is a Python package that provides a simple interface for synthesizing text into speech using different TTS engines, including Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and Wit.ai Text-to-Speech (Wit TTS).

## Installation

You can install `speech-engine` using pip:

```bash
pip install speech-engine
```

## Usage
### TTS_GOOGLE
```python
from speech_engine import TTS_Google, FileExtensionError

# Instantiate TTS_Google
tts = TTS_Google()

# Set the language and other options
tts.set_language('en')
tts.set_slow(False)

# Synthesize and play speech
tts.speak("Hello, world!")

# Synthesize and save speech as an audio file
try:
    tts.save("Hello, world!", "output.mp3")
except FileExtensionError as e:
    print(e.message)
```

### TTS_Witai
```python
from speech_engine import TTS_Witai

# Instantiate TTS_Witai with the Wit.ai auth token
tts = TTS_Witai(your_authtoken)

# Set the voice
tts.set_voice('Colin')

# Synthesize and play speech
tts.speak("Hello, world!")

# Synthesize and save speech as an audio file
tts.save("Hello, world!", "output.mp3")


# Get available voices
voices = tts.get_voices()
print(voices)
```

### TTS_Openai
```python
from speech_engine import TTS_Openai

# Instantiate TTS_Openai with the Openai Api key
tts = TTS_Openai(your_apikey)

# Set the voice
tts.set_voice('alloy')

# Synthesize and play speech
tts.speak("Hello, world!")

# Synthesize and save speech as an audio file
tts.save("Hello, world!", "output.mp3")


# Get available voices
voices = tts.get_voices()
print(voices)
```
