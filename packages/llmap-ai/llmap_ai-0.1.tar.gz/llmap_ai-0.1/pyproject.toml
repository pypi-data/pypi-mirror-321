description = """
LLMap is a high-performance CLI code search tool designed for use with large codebases.
Uses DeepSeek-V3 to intelligently identify relevant code context through multi-stage analysis:

1. Fast skeleton-based pre-filtering
2. Targeted deep analysis
3. Smart context refinement

Features:
- Massively parallel search
- Smart caching for speed and cost optimization
- Multi-stage filtering to minimize processing
- Built for integration with AI coding assistants

Currently supports Python and Java skeletonization, with full-text analysis for other languages.

Perfect for finding precise context to feed into AI code-authoring tools like Aider and Cursor.
