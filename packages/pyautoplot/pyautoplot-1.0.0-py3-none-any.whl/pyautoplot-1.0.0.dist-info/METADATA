PyAutoPlot is an open-source Python library designed to make dataset analysis much easier by generating helpful detailed plots using `matplotlib`. It automatically generates appropriate plots based on the dataset you feed it.

## Installation

You can install PyAutoPlot using pip:

```bash
pip install pyautoplot
```

## Supported Python Versions

PyAutoPlot supports the following Python versions:

- Python 3.6
- Python 3.7
- Python 3.8
- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11/Later (Preferred)

Please ensure that you have one of these Python versions installed before using PyAutoPlot. PyAutoPlot may not work as expected on lower versions of Python than the supported.

## Features

- **Automatic Plotting**: PyAutoPlot automatically generates appropriate plots based on values present in your dataset. Currently, PyAutoPlot supports the following types of data: `numeric`, `categorical`, and `time-series`.
- **Customization**: Due to matplotlib's high customizability, you can create and use custom themes for PyAutoPlot, just pass in your theme as a dictionary of RCParams (See `plot.rcParams.keys()` for a list of valid parameters) or choose from our predefined themes. You can also pass in additional parameters to the function that `matplotlib` can recognize (e.g. `color='#5d17eb'`).

## Usage

### AutoPlot

```python
from pyautoplot import AutoPlot

# Initialize with a CSV file
plotter = AutoPlot("path/to/dataset.csv")

# Automatically analyze and plot
plotter.auto_plot(output_file='test', theme="dark", color='orange', excludes=['detailed_analysis'])
```

> [!NOTE]
> PyAutoPlot may not work well with certain datasets. If you find any issues please open an issue.

### Customization

```python
from pyautoplot import AutoPlot

# Define your custom theme
custom_theme = {
    "axes.facecolor": "#ffffff",
    "axes.edgecolor": "#000000",
    "axes.labelcolor": "#000000",
    "figure.facecolor": "#ffffff",
    "grid.color": "#dddddd",
    "text.color": "#000000",
    "xtick.color": "#000000",
    "ytick.color": "#000000",
    "legend.frameon": True,
}

# Initialize with a CSV file
plotter = AutoPlot("path/to/dataset.csv")

# Automatically analyze and plot using the custom theme
plotter.auto_plot(output_file='test', theme=custom_theme, color='orange', excludes=['detailed_analysis'])
```
