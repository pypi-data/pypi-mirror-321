# RdfCrate

RO-Crate builder that uses RDF concepts.

**[Detailed documentation available here](https://wehi-soda-hub.github.io/RdfCrate/)**.

## Advantages

* Simple API that doesn't require understanding JSON-LD
* Library of types and properties to speed up development and ensure correctness
* Valid JSON-LD guaranteed
* Type checker friendly

## Example

Let's say you have a directory with one file in it, which you want to document.
Here's how you could make an RO-Crate using RdfCrate:

```{python}
from rdfcrate import AttachedCrate, uris
from rdflib import Literal

crate = AttachedCrate("/path/to/crate")
crate.register_file("salvatore.jpg", [
    (uris.name, Literal("Salvatore the Seal"))
])
print(crate.compile())
```
