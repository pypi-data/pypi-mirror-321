# itasca-stub

This repository contains code to generate `itasca.pyi` for PFC 7.00.

Itasca provides great python interface, But it is too weak compared to PyCharm.
When writing PFC in PyCharm, the keyword `itasca` has no typehint.
Thus, the project is developed, and here's a preview.

## Installation

### Manual

Copy the `itasca` directory to your python `site-packages` directory.
Make sure to copy to your current environment.
If the internal Python of PFC is used, then you should copy to the path like:
`Itasca\pfc900\exe64\python36\Lib\site-packages`.

### pip

```cmd
pip install itasca-stub-pfc9
```

Best wishes!
