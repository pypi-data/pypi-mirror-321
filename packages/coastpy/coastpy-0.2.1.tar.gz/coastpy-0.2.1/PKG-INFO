# CoastPy

Python tools for cloud-native coastal analytics.

## Installation

You can install coastpy with pip in a Python environment where [GDAL](https://pypi.org/project/GDAL/) and [pyproj](https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/) are already installed.

```bash
pip install coastpy
```

However, if you start from scratch, it's probably easier to install with conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

## Data

The data that is produced with this software can be directly accessed via the cloud using
tools like
[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/?version=stable&environment=cli&platform=macos&download_method=package_manager);
see the [tutorials](./tutorials/) and [analytics](./analytics/) other for other access
methods (Python) and latest usage instructions.

### Global Coastal Transect System (GCTS)

Cross-shore coastal transects are essential to coastal monitoring, offering a consistent
reference line to measure coastal change, while providing a robust foundation to map
coastal characteristics and derive coastal statistics thereof.

The Global Coastal Transect System consists of more than 11 million cross-shore coastal
transects uniformly spaced at 100-m intervals alongshore, for all OpenStreetMap
coastlines that are longer than 5 kilometers.

```bash
# Download all transects located in the United States.
duckdb -c "COPY (SELECT * FROM 'az://coclico.blob.core.windows.net/gcts/release/2024-08-02/*.parquet' AS gcts WHERE gcts.country = 'US') TO 'United_States.parquet' (FORMAT 'PARQUET')"
```

```bash
# Download transects by bounding box.
duckdb -c "COPY (SELECT * FROM 'az://coclico.blob.core.windows.net/gcts/release/2024-08-02/*.parquet' AS gcts WHERE bbox.xmin <= 14.58 AND bbox.ymin <= -22.77 AND bbox.xmax >= 14.27 AND bbox.ymax >= -23.57) TO area_of_interest.parquet (FORMAT 'PARQUET')"
```

```bash
# Or, download the data in bulk using AZ CLI
az storage blob download-batch \
    --destination "./" \
    --source "gcts" \
    --pattern "release/2024-08-02/*.parquet" \
    --account-name coclico
```

### Coastal Grid

The Coastal Grid dataset provides a global tiling system for coastal analytics. It
supports scalable data processing workflows by offering coastal tiles at varying zoom
levels (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) and buffer sizes (500 m, 1000 m, 2000 m, 5000 m, 10000 m, 15000 m).

## Usage

More installation and usage instructions will come when we build the documentation. For
now, to run the tutorials, analytics or scripts proceed as follows. Clone the repository,
and install the [environment](environment.yaml) using a package manager like
[miniconda](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#download). Then you
may use Jupyter lab to run and/or explore the (interactive) content in the notebooks.

```bash
git clone https://TUDelft-CITG/coastpy.git
cd coastpy
mamba env create -f environment.yml
jupyter lab
```
