# cloudera-assist

A CLI application for managing credentials and executing playbooks for Cloudera demonstrations, workshops, and tutorials.

Built with [![Hatch](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A5%9A-Hatch-4051b5.svg)](https://github.com/pypa/hatch)

# Install

Install the CLI tool (in your preferred `venv` manager):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera-assist.git
```

And then run `cldr-assist` in any `ansible-navigator`-enabled Cloudera project!

# Usage

tk tk

# Develop

`cloudera-assist` uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) to manage the build process and environments and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing.

Install the two management tools to your system, e.g. `brew install uv hatch`.

To work with a CLI development shell, run `hatch shell` to spin up a `venv` with the project's dependencies and some additional libraries for `pytest`.

You can then run tests using `hatch run test`.

Versioning can be handled by `hatch version` and its permutations; the tool is set to manage the `VERSION` variable in `src/cloudera_assist/__version__.py`.

To add a new Python dependency, run `uv add <the library>`. This will update the `pyproject.toml` file and the general `venv` for the project.
