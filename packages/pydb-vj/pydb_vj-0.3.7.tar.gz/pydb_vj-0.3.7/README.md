# Description

This documentation explains how to use the `db_system.py` file, which contains classes and methods for handling JSON files with databases in a specifically designed manner.

## Usage

Before using the `db_system.py` file, make sure you've installed the required dependencies. In this case, it only requires os and json modules.

```python
import os
import json
```

To use the provided functionality, import the `DataBase` class from the `db_system.py` file:

```python
from db_system import DataBase
```

Now you can utilize the various methods available for handling JSON files within the class (`DataBase`).

## Methods

### `__init__(self, source_path: str) -> None:`
This method initializes a new instance of the `DataBase` class with a given `source_path` where your JSON files are stored. It takes one mandatory parameter: `source_path`.

Example:

```python
source_path = "C:/Users/huina/Python Projects/Important projects/Libs/db_py/pydb/data"
my_database = DataBase(source_path)
```

### `read(self, name: str) -> dict:`
This method reads the content of a specified JSON file and returns it as a dictionary. It takes one mandatory parameter: `name` (the name of the JSON file without extension).

Example:

```python
data = my_database.read("sample_file")
```

### `save(self, name: str, new_data: any) -> None:`
This method saves a new dictionary or updates an existing one in a specified JSON file. It takes two mandatory parameters: `name` (the name of the JSON file without extension), and `new_data` (a new dictionary to be saved or updated).

Example:

```python
my_database.save("sample_file", {"key": "value"})
```

### `add_element(self, name: str, key: any, data: dict):`
This method adds a new element (specified by `key`) to an existing dictionary within the specified JSON file. The parameters include `name` (the name of the JSON file without extension), `key` (the identifier of the new element), and `data` (the data of the element to be added).

Example:

```python
my_database.add_element("sample_file", "new_key", {"some_value": "example"})
```

### `edit_element(self, name: str, key: any, low_data: dict):`
This method edits an existing element within a specified dictionary in the specified JSON file. It takes three mandatory parameters: `name` (the name of the JSON file without extension), `key` (the identifier of the element to be edited), and `low_data` (a dictionary with the new values to be updated).

Example:

```python
my_database.edit_element("sample_file", "existing_key", {"some_key": "new_value"})
```

This documentation covers the basic usage of the `db_system.py` file and explains how you can use each method provided by the `DataBase` class. For full documentation, visit the official repository or contact the developers.
