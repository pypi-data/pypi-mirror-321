The interaction:\n\n1. The ***user*** requests the execution of a computational pipeline to ***solver*** given some `inputs`\n2. The ***Solver*** computes the `outputs` and their `receipt`, communicating them back to the ***user***\n3. The ***User*** requests the verification of the computation to ***verifier*** given `inputs` and `receipt`\n\nThe core building block of the implementation is the `Solver` abstract class defined in [models.py](./src/warden_spex/models.py)\nthat the developer needs to implement.\nA reference implementation for the class is provided by the `SimpleSolver` class in [test_spex.py](./tests/test_spex.py), \nwhich implements the `solve` (step 2) and `verify` (step 3) methods.\n\nThe verification process re-executes a randomized portion of the computational pipeline to verify its integrity,\nevaluating a certain percentage of the computation.\n\n## LICENSE\n\n```\nCopyright 2024 Warden Protocol <https://wardenprotocol.org/>\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```',
