# Tooling Library for Notebooks Release Notes

## Summary

This is the first release of the library with the Solar Maintenance App! ðŸŽ‰
The repo provides tools to monitor and maintain solar energy systems with the following key features:
- **Data Fetching and Processing:** Retrieve and preprocess weather and solar production data from external APIs (`frequenz-api-weather` and `frequenz-client-reporting`).
- **Prediction Model Preparation:** Prepare basic time series models for solar power predictions.
- **Visualisation Tools:** Generate calendar views, rolling averages, production profiles and daily statistics available via the `*Plotter` classes. Control what/how much data to show and how to display it using the corresponding configuration options. Customise the plots using tools like `PlotStyleStrategy` and `PlotManager`.
- **Translation Support:** Enable English and German translations via the `TranslationManager` class, for controlling all text displayed on the plots and tables.
- **Single Entry Point:** Integrate data fetching, processing and visualisations into a main workflow.
- **Notification Service:** Send alert notifications via email with support for scheduling and retries, including a linear backoff mechanism.

This release provides tools to solar system operators to monitor performance and track trends, and lays the groundwork for identifying potential system issues.

Moreover it includes a microgrid config module that contains component configs to get component IDs and formulas for component types (e.g. PV, battery) and metadata information (e.g. gridpool ID).
