## Description

`pyaga8` is a Python package that provides bindings for the AGA8 algorithm (GERG-2008 and DETAIL equations). The core functionality is implemented in Rust for performance, and it is exposed to Python using the `pyo3` library.

`pyaga8` is used by the `pvtlib` package: https://pypi.org/project/pvtlib/

## Installation

You can install the package using `pip`:

```sh
pip install pyaga8
