The Lexico Random Forest Classifier is an advanced ensemble algorithm specifically designed for longitudinal data analysis. 
This classifier extends the traditional random forest algorithm by incorporating a lexicographic optimisation approach 
to select the best split at each node.

!!! quote "Lexicographic Optimisation"
    The primary goal of this approach is to prioritise the selection of more recent data points (wave ids) when
    determining splits in the decision tree, based on the premise that recent measurements are typically 
    more predictive and relevant than older ones.

    Key Features:
    
    1. **Lexicographic Optimisation:** The approach prioritizes features based on both their information gain ratios and the recency of the data, favoring splits with more recent information.
    2. **Cython Adaptation**: This implementation leverages a fork of Scikit-learnâ€™s fast C++-powered decision tree to ensure that the Lexico Random Forest is fast and efficient, avoiding the potential slowdown of a from-scratch Python implementation. Further details on the algorithm can be found in the Cython adaptation available [here at Scikit-Lexicographical-Trees](https://github.com/simonprovost/scikit-lexicographical-trees/blob/21443b9dce51434b3198ccabac8bafc4698ce953/sklearn/tree/_splitter.pyx#L695) specifically in the `node_lexicoRF_split` function.

## Examples

### Dummy Longitudinal Dataset

!!! example "Consider the following dataset: `stroke.csv`"
    Features:
    
    - `smoke` (longitudinal) with two waves/time-points
    - `cholesterol` (longitudinal) with two waves/time-points
    - `age` (non-longitudinal)
    - `gender` (non-longitudinal)

    Target:
    
    - `stroke` (binary classification) at wave/time-point 2 only for the sake of the example
    
    The dataset is shown below (`w` stands for `wave` in ELSA):

    | smoke_w1 | smoke_w2 | cholesterol_w1 | cholesterol_w2 | age | gender | stroke_w2 |
    |--------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----|--------|---------------|
    | 0            | 1            | 0                  | 1                  | 45  | 1      | 0             |
    | 1            | 1            | 1                  | 1                  | 50  | 0      | 1             |
    | 0            | 0            | 0                  | 0                  | 55  | 1      | 0             |
    | 1            | 1            | 1                  | 1                  | 60  | 0      | 1             |
    | 0            | 1            | 0                  | 1                  | 65  | 1      | 0             |

### Example 1: Basic Usage

``` py title="Example_1: Default Parameters" linenums="1" hl_lines="6-8"
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from scikit_longitudinal.estimators.ensemble.lexicographical import LexicoRandomForestClassifier

features_group = [(0, 1), (2, 3)]  # (1)

clf = LexicoRandomForestClassifier(
    features_group=features_group
)
clf.fit(X, y)
y_pred = clf.predict(X)

accuracy_score(y, y_pred)  # (2)
```

1. Either define the features_group manually or use a pre-set from the LongitudinalDataset class. It is unnecessary to include "non-longitudinal" features in this algorithm because they are not used in the lexicographical technique approach but are obviously used in the standard decision tree procedure.  If the data was from the ELSA database, you could have used the pre-sets such as `.setup_features_group('elsa')`.
2. Calculate the accuracy score for the predictions. Can use other metrics as well.

### Example 2: How-To Set Threshold Gain of the Lexicographical Approach

``` py title="Example_2: How-To Set Threshold Gain of the Lexicographical Approach" linenums="1" hl_lines="6-9"
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from scikit_longitudinal.estimators.ensemble.lexicographical import LexicoRandomForestClassifier

features_group = [(0, 1), (2, 3)]  # (1)

clf = LexicoRandomForestClassifier(
    threshold_gain=0.001,  # (2)
    features_group=features_group
)

clf.fit(X, y)
y_pred = clf.predict(X)

accuracy_score(y, y_pred)  # (3)
```

1. Define the features_group manually or use a pre-set from the LongitudinalDataset class. It is unnecessary to include "non-longitudinal" features in this algorithm because they are not used in the lexicographical technique approach but are obviously used in the standard decision tree procedure. If the data was from the ELSA database, you could have used the pre-sets such as `.setup_features_group('elsa')`.
2. Set the threshold gain for the lexicographical approach. The lower the value, the closer the gain ratio needs to be between the two features to be considered equal before employing the lexicographical approach (i.e., the more recent wave will be chosen under certain conditions). The higher the value, the larger the gap can be between the gain ratios of the two features for the lexicographical approach to be employed.
3. Calculate the accuracy score for the predictions. Can use other metrics as well.

### Example 3: How-To Set the Number of Estimators

``` py title="Example_3: How-To Set the Number of Estimators" linenums="1" hl_lines="6-9"
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from scikit_longitudinal.estimators.ensemble.lexicographical import LexicoRandomForestClassifier

features_group = [(0, 1), (2, 3)]  # (1)

clf = LexicoRandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=200,  # (2)
    features_group=features_group
)

clf.fit(X, y)
y_pred = clf.predict(X)

accuracy_score(y, y_pred)  # (3)
```

1. Define the features_group manually or use a pre-set from the LongitudinalDataset class. It is unnecessary to include "non-longitudinal" features in this algorithm because they are not used in the lexicographical technique approach but are obviously used in the standard decision tree procedure. If the data was from the ELSA database, you could have used the pre-sets such as `.setup_features_group('elsa')`.
2. Set the number of estimators (trees) in the forest.
3. Calculate the accuracy score for the predictions. Can use other metrics as well.
