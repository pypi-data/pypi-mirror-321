Welcome to foamquant's documentation! (Documentation in progress)
===================================

[![Binder]] (https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/floschott/FoamQuant_binder/master?labpath=Example_Process.ipynb)

**foamquant** is a toolbox specifically created for processing time series of 3D images of evolving liquid foams by using open source libraries Scikit-Image [vanderWalt2014]_ and SPAM [Stamani2020]_. 

The **objective** is a greater accessibility of time-resolved liquid foam 3D analysis tools for the foam-physicis and food scientists communitites.

We propose a readthedocs documentation with three sections: **API reference**, **Jupyter Notebooks Examples**.  **Tutorials**


Tools
-----------------

Diagram showing the organisation of the python functions in the different sub-modules. The functions in red are not included in the package yet.


Elastic and plastic deformations quantification tools
-----------------

1) Elastic deformation field:

   - Shape field, defined in [Graner2008]_ and first used in [Raufaste2015]_

   - Texture field, defined in [Graner2008]_

   - Elastic internal strain field, defined in [Graner2008]_ 

2) Detection of created / disappeared films (contacts)

3) Plastic deformation field (T1)

Label traking 
-----------------
The tracking method was inspired by ID-track presented in [Ando2013]_ and uses DVC SPAM-ddic [Hall2010]_ [Ando2013]_.

1) Bubble traking

.. figure:: tracking_3d.PNG

Tracking of five bubbles, showing various tracked properties: elastic internal strain, contact, velocity, and volume.

2) Film traking


Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------
Examples on how we can use Scikit-Image and SPAM for extracting:

1) Liquid fraction and Plateau border radius

2) Bubble volume distribution

3) Coordination distribution (uing SPAM [Stamani2020]_)

4) Foam flow field (inspired by ID-track in [Ando2013]_ or DVC SPAM-ddic [Hall2010]_ [Ando2013]_)
