        """
        An abstract class for a mask that represents data structure that can be in 1D, 2D or other shapes.

        When applied to data it extracts or masks the unmasked image pixels corresponding to mask entries
        that are (`False` or 0).

        The mask also defines the geometry of the data structure it is paired with, for example how its pixels convert
        to physical units via the pixel_scales and origin parameters and a grid which is used for
        perform calculations via super-sampling.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mask
            The ndarray containing the bool's representing the mask, where `False` signifies an entry is
            unmasked and used in calculations.
        pixel_scales
            The scaled units to pixel units conversion factors of every pixel. If this is input as a float, it is
            converted to a (float, float) structure.
        origin
            The origin of the mask's coordinate system in scaled units.
