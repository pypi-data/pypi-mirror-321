- **Customizable Base URL**: Specify the API's base URL during client initialization.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Detailed exception classes (`InvalidAPIKeyError`, `InsufficientCreditsError`, etc.) for better error handling.
- **Pydantic Models**: Uses Pydantic for data validation and serialization.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Python codebases.

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. **Obtain an API Key**  
   Make sure you have a valid API key for your FastAPI service. You need to provide this API key and the base URL of the API.

2. **Import the Client**
   ```python
   from aethra.client import AethraClient
   ```

3. **Initialize the Client**
   ```python
   client = AethraClient(api_key="your_api_key_here", base_url="http://your-api-base-url")
   ```

---

## Example

Below is a simple script that demonstrates sending a conversation for analysis:

```python
from aethra.client import AethraClient
from aethra.exceptions import (
    InvalidAPIKeyError,
    InsufficientCreditsError,
    AnalysisError,
    AethraAPIError
)

def main():
    # Replace with your actual API key and base URL
    api_key = "your_api_key_here"
    base_url = "base_url"

    # Initialize the client
    client = AethraClient(api_key=api_key, base_url=base_url)

    # Example conversation data
    conversation_data = {
        "conversation_1": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I need help with my account."},
            {"role": "agent", "content": "Sure, could you please provide me with your account ID?"},
            {"role": "user", "content": "It's 12345."}
        ],
        "conversation_2": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Can I change my subscription plan?"},
            {"role": "agent", "content": "Yes, you can change it from the settings page. Would you like me to guide you through the process?"},
            {"role": "user", "content": "That would be helpful. Thank you."}
        ],
        "conversation_3": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "How can I reset my password?"},
            {"role": "agent", "content": "To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' on the login page and follow the instructions."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Got it, thanks."}
        ]
    }

    try:
        response = client.analyse(
            conversation_data=conversation_data,
            min_clusters=5,
            max_clusters=10,
            embedding_model="text-embedding-ada-002",
            top_k_nearest_to_centroid=10,
            tau=0.1
        )
        print("Analysis Result:")
        print(response)

    except InvalidAPIKeyError:
        print("Invalid API Key provided.")
    except InsufficientCreditsError:
        print("Insufficient credits for analysis.")
    except AnalysisError as e:
        print(f"Analysis failed: {e}")
    except AethraAPIError as e:
        print(f"API Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Run the script:

```bash
python example_usage.py
```

   python -m unittest discover tests
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python ./tests/test_client.py
