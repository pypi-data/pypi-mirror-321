    <p>You can have
      <em>
        <strong>strong and empashized
        </strong>
      </em> text.
    </p>
    <p>You can also apply styles to
      <em>
        <strong>
          <code>verbatim
          </code>
        </strong>
      </em>.
    </p>
    <p>But verbatim will
      <code>_*preserve*_
      </code> them.
    </p>
    <p>You can use _single *markers.
    </p>
    <p>But you _need_ to escape pairs.
    </p>
    <p>Even though you can escape _only one_ of the two.
    </p>
    <p>If you have _more than two_ it's better to just _escape_ all of them.
    </p>
    <p>Oh, this is valid for `verbatim as well.
