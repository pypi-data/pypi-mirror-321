Hi, thanks for contributing to this project!

We noticed that this PR is missing a `RELEASE.md` file. We use that to automatically do releases here on GitHub and, most importantly, to PyPI!

So as soon as this PR is merged, a release will be made ðŸš€.

Here's an example of `RELEASE.md`:

```markdown
---
release type: patch
---

Description of the changes, ideally with some examples, if adding a new feature.
```

Release type can be one of patch, minor or major. We use [semver](https://semver.org/), so make sure to pick the appropriate type. If in doubt feel free to ask :)
