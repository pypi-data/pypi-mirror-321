# indipyclient

You may have Python programs implementing some form of data collection or control and wish to remotely operate such an instrument.

An associated package 'indipydriver' can be used to take your data, organise it into a data structure defined by the INDI protocol, and serve it on a port.

This indipyclient package provides a terminal client, which connects to the port, allowing you to view and control your instrument from a terminal session.

It can be installed from Pypi with:

    pip install indipyclient

indipydriver and indipyclient communicate with the INDI protocol.

INDI - Instrument Neutral Distributed Interface.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_Neutral_Distributed_Interface

The indipyclient terminal client can be started from the command line, and can also be imported if required, in which case it provides a set of classes which can be used to create scripts to control the remote instrument.

The client can be run with

indipyclient [options]

or with

python3 -m indipyclient [options]

The package help is:

    usage: indipyclient [options]

    Terminal client to communicate to an INDI service.

    options:
      -h, --help                show this help message and exit
      -p PORT, --port PORT      Port of the INDI server (default 7624).
      --host HOST               Hostname/IP of the INDI server (default localhost).
      -b BLOBS, --blobs BLOBS   Optional folder where BLOB's will be saved.
      --loglevel LOGLEVEL       Enables logging, value 1, 2, 3 or 4.
      --logfile LOGFILE         File where logs will be saved
      --version                 show program's version number and exit

    The BLOB's folder can also be set from within the session.
    Setting loglevel and logfile should only be used for brief
    diagnostic purposes, the logfile could grow very big.
    loglevel:1 Information and error messages only, no exception trace.
    The following levels enable exception traces in the logs
    loglevel:2 As 1 plus xml vector tags without members or contents,
    loglevel:3 As 1 plus xml vectors and members - but not BLOB contents,
    loglevel:4 As 1 plus xml vectors and all contents


A typical session would look like:

The INDI protocol defines the format of the data sent, such as light, number, text, switch or BLOB (Binary Large Object). The client is general purpose, taking the format of switches, numbers etc., from the protocol.

INDI is often used with astronomical instruments, but is a general purpose protocol which can be used for any instrument control.
