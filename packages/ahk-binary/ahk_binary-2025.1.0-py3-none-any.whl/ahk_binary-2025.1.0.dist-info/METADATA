ahk-binary
==========

Packages the AutoHotkey binary as an installable Python package. Intended for use with the [`ahk` package](https://pypi.org/project/ahk/).

The license of AutoHotkey is included in the `AutoHotkey_LICENSE` file.

Installation:

Since this is used as an accessory to the `ahk` package, the recommended way to do this is to use the "extras" from ahk::

    $ pip install ahk[binary]

Alternatively, it can be installed directly::

    $ pip install ahk-binary
