# Code for "The Debugging Book"

This folder holds the code from "The Debugging Book".
Software has bugs, and finding bugs can involve lots of effort.  This book addresses this problem by _automating_ software debugging, specifically by _locating errors and their causes automatically_.  Recent years have seen the development of novel techniques that lead to dramatic improvements in automated software debugging.  They now are mature enough to be assembled in a book â€“ even with executable code. 

For details (and all of the book!), see the web site: https://www.debuggingbook.org/


## Using the Code

The book has plenty of examples for using the code; you are encouraged to read it and then to use this code to try things out.

### Importing

You can import the modules in your own projects and use the infrastructure, as in

```python
from debuggingbook.Debugger import Debugger
with Debugger():
    function__to_be_debugged()
```

### Running

You can also execute the files directly to run the examples from the book, as in

```shell
$ ./Debugger.py
```

Enjoy!
