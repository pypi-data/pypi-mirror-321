ColiVara

Colivara is a suite of services that allows you to store, search, and retrieve documents based on their visual embeddings.      It is a web-first implementation of the ColPali paper using ColQwen2 as backend model. It works exacly like RAG from the end-user standpoint - but using vision models instead of chunking and text-processing for documents.
