This example shows how to use a Chain Of Thought code agent to run python code and bash commands.
It uses volumes (see tools.py) and is based on Chain Of Thought Agent class.
Progress can be checked in the /output folder.
There will be a code file with the code that AI has written, 
a thoughts file with the thoughts 
and a results file with the results.
