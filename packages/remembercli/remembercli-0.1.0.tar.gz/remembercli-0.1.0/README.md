# rememberCLI

A simple task managing CLI program written in [Python](https://www.python.org/), built with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), and packaged with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

The design of the program was heavily influenced by the amazing [CLI Guidlines](https://clig.dev/).

This program is also uses the powerful date parsing tool in [dateparser](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to process stdin date inputs.

All data are stored locally as JSON.

rememberCLI takes advantage of the minimalistic and peaceful nature of the command line interface.
