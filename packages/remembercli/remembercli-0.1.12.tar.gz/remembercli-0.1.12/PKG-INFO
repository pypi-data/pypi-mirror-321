# rememberCLI

A simple task managing CLI program written in [Python](https://www.python.org/), built with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), and packaged with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

The design of the program was heavily influenced by the amazing [CLI Guidlines](https://clig.dev/).

This program is also uses the powerful date parsing tool in [dateparser](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to process stdin date inputs.

All data are stored locally as JSON.

rememberCLI may be forked and modified with no restrictions. Pull requests are encouraged so improvements may be shared with the community.

rememberCLI is still a work in progress with a lot of improvements to be made.

Prerequisites
---

### Python
The current version of rememberCLI was developed in a virtual environment running Python 3.12 so make sure your machine has the same or a newer version of python installed.

This [article](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) by Real Python is an in-depth guide for installing Python on various operating systems.

After you get Python installed, be sure to add it to PATH. This [article](https://realpython.com/add-python-to-path/), also by Real Python, explains what PATH is and how to add your fresh Python install to it.

You could also opt to take a look at the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) instead.

### pip

[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is a package installer for Python. You will be using it to install rememberCLI.

Usually, pip is included with a Python installation. You can run the following code to check if pip is installed on your machine.

```
pip --version
```

If pip isn't installed, run the following code from the [official pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install it.

```
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

Installation
---

Installing rememberCLI should be fairly easy and straightforward.

Run the following code to install rememberCLI

```
pip install remembercli
```

Try running `rem` or `rem --help` to see if rememberCLI installed properly.


Usage
---

The commands for rememberCLI were designed to be intuitive and easy to use.

When in doubt, use the `--help` option for learn more about a particular command. E.g. `rem show --help`

### Important: To use or not to use `--help`

Some commands, like `rem add` or `rem`, will show the help menu with and without the `--help` option explicitly typed.

Therefore, `rem add` is the same as `rem add --help`. Similarly, `rem` is the same as `rem --help`.

This is because `rem add` only adds an item when it receives arguments (inputs). Without any arguments, it defaults to showing the help menu.

The `rem` command works the same. It expects additional commands and arguments to know what exactly to do. Without them, it defaults to also showing the help menu.

However, `rem show` and `rem init` can work without any additional arguments or options passed to them. So the only way to show the help menu would be to explicitly type the `--help` option.

Therefore, it is recommended to always use the `--help` option when it doubt to avoid unintentionally running any commands.

### Important: Initializing rememberCLI after installation

To use rememberCLI, you have to initialize a directory and a JSON file. Don't worry, you only have to run the following command

```
rem init
```

This command does three things:
1. First, it creates a config file that will contain the path to your vault file
2. Then, it creates a vault directory in your home directly where your vault file will live
3. And finally, it creates a vault.json file that will contain all rememberCLI data

**rememberCLI will create directories and vault files in the home directory by default.**

- Typically, you will only need to run this command once, right after installing rememberCLI for the first time. 

- If you wish to use a new vault file, directory, or both, you can run this command again. 

- Make sure that you use a different directory name if you wish to keep using the same name for your vault file, or if you wish to keep using the same directory as before but want to use a new vault file, make sure the name of the vault file is different than the existing one. Your config file will be updated to point to your new vault file accordingly.

- You can also run the command to switch between different directories and vault files. Make sure to enter the names correctly or the init command will create unwanted directories and vault files.

### Adding a Task/Note: the `add` command

To add an item to rememberCLI, you will use the `add` command.

Go ahead and run the following command(s) to see all the options available to the `add` command

```
rem add
```
or

```
rem add --help
```

At the present, the `add` command has three additional options available to it.

**It is important that you use quotes, double or single, to pass in arguments (inputs). Without quotes, rememberCLI, and other CLI tools in general, will think of your inputs as commands it has to look for and execute.**

#### Adding a task for a given day

To add a task for a given day, you would use the following format

```
rem add 'today's task'
```

#### Adding a task with a note for a given day

To add a task and an associated note, you would use the following format

```
rem add 'today's task' --note 'note for the task'
```

#### Adding a note without any corresponding task for a given day

You can add a standalone note with the following format

```
rem add --note 'a note'
```

#### Adding a task for the next day

You can use the following format to add a task for the next day

```
rem add 'tomorrow's task' --tom
```

#### Adding a task and a note for the next day

You can use the following format to add a task and an associated note for the next day

```
rem add 'tomorrow's task' --note 'note for task' --tom
```

#### Adding a note for the next day

You can use the following format to add a standalone note for the next day

```
rem add --note 'a note' --tom
```

### Important: adding items for a specific date using the `--for` option

The `--for` option can read date inputs in various formats thanks to the powerful [dateparser](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library, but it still has its limitations.

I would encourage you to take a look at the official documentation of the [dateparser](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to get on top of the acceptable formats.

**As of right now, rememberCLI doesn't support time parsing**

#### Adding a task for a specific date

You can use the following formats to add a task for a specific date.

```
rem add 'a task' --for 'Jan 5, 2025'
```

rem add 'a task' --for '23-06-2025'
```
```
rem add 'a task' --for '4th January, 2025'
```

#### Adding a task and a note for a specific date
