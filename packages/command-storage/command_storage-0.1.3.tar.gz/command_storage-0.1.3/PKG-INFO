## About

`cmds` is a command-line tool designed to store CLI commands for quick access and usage.
Think of it as a simple notes app specifically tailored for storing commands using
customizable keys.

Oftentimes, we find ourselves needing to store certain commands for later use. These may
be commands that are not easily remembered or ones that we find useful but don't want to
keep looking up. Traditionally, we might store these commands in a file and then copy
and paste them into the terminal when needed. Recognizing the need for a more efficient
solution, I decided to create a CLI application to streamline this process.

You can find the project on [pip](https://pypi.org/project/command-storage/).

## Features

- Store CLI commands with custom keys for easy retrieval.
- Quickly access stored commands with fuzzy search without the need to search through
  files.
- Organize commands based on your workflow or preferences.
- Export all commands into a JSON file.

## Installation

Using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/command-storage/).

```bash
pip install command-storage
```

To build the pypi package locally and push to pypi:

```bash
python -m build

# Upload for testing to test pypi
twine upload -r testpypi dist/*

# Upload to pypi
twine upload dist/*
```

Using [brew](https://brew.sh/). Gem file maintained in repository [homebrew-command-storage](https://github.com/ashu-tosh-kumar/homebrew-command-storage).
  
```bash
brew tap ashu-tosh-kumar/command-storage
brew install command-storage
```

Using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/).

```bash
pipx install command-storage
```

**NOTE**: Initialize the application by running `cmds init`. Note that if you want to
have cross platform sync of data, you can choose location of file to be inside a drive
installed on your system like Onedrive.

## Examples

Seeking help.

```bash
cmds --help
```

Storing some commands into the `cmds`.

```bash
cmds store --key "count no of files" --command "ls | wc -l" --description "count no of files in a directory"
cmds store --key "run python test with cov" --command "pytest --cov --cov-report term --cov-report xml:coverage.xml" --description "pytest with cov"
```

Viewing all commands stored in `cmds`.

```bash
cmds list
```

- `update`: Allows updating a stored command by its key.

### `cmds copy`

Allows copying a command by its key.

**Usage**:

cmds copy [OPTIONS] [KEY]
```

**Arguments**:

- `[KEY]`: Key for the command.

**Options**:

cmds list [OPTIONS] [KEY]
```

**Arguments**:

- `[KEY]`: Key for the command.

**Options**:

- `-l, --limit INTEGER`: Number of results to show. 0 means all results.  [default: 5]

- `--help`: Show this message and exit.

### `cmds update`

Allows updating a stored command by its key. Also supports changing the key.

**Usage**:

## Release History

`0.1.0`

- First working release (built using Python 3.11).

`0.1.1`

- Lowered Python version requirement to 3.9. Added support to be installable via
multiple package managers.

`0.1.2`

- `list` command uses `key` as argument instead of option for wider app
consistency.
- `list` command supports passing `--limit` option to limit no. of search results. Works
  for both with and without fuzzy search.
- Added `copy` command to allow copying a command by its key.
- Added a probability threshold for fuzzy search in `list` command. This helps in
  returning only meaningful matches.
- **[BUG FIX]** Fixed `init` command overwriting existing database file.

`0.1.3`

- package upgrades.
