# ABOUT

This Python package provides a robust toolkit for analyzing 1D cellular automata by identifying and categorizing shift-invariant domains and emergent particle dynamics. It includes methods for discovering domains, finding particles, and exploring their interactions in automata with arbitrary rules and configurations.
