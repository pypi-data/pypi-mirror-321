### About
FBRef Stats is a Python script which uses *BeautifulSoup* and *requests* to scrape data from [FBRef].
This is a small side project I work on in my free time. As an avid soccer fan and someone who finds sports stats interesting, I tried making a program analysing the performance of different players. However, I could not find many good free libraries which provided soccer data, so I resolved to build one myself.


### Installation
To install this project, input the following into the command line:
```sh
pip install fbrefstats
```
From there, you can import the package into your program using:

```sh
from fbrefstats import LeagueScraper, GeneralScraper, StatStrings
```

### Usage
As seen above, there are three classes within the ```fbrefstats``` script:
(The names of these classes may change in the future, they are currently placeholders)
- ```LeagueScraper```
  - Contains scraping methods relating to leagues. An object is needed to access these methods, with each object representing a specific league.
- ```GeneralScraper```
  - Contains scraping methods that are *independant*. They are static and do not tie into any specific league.
- ```StatStrings```
  - Class full of variables holding strings, which are used when calling the method ```LeagueScraper.getLeagueLeaders()```

**Check out the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) for info on how to use the script.**

### Dependencies
As of now, the libraries used within this project are:
- ```BeautifulSoup4```
- ```requests```
- ```pandas```
- ```fake-http-reader``` | Link to the repo [here](https://github.com/MichaelTatarski/fake-http-header)
- ```lxml```
- ```html5lib```

### To-do
As of right now, this script is still in a very early development phase, and I am only working on it as a personal side project. I have a few things I am thinking of adding:

- **Update ```README.md``` (Urgent)** ☑
- **Add a documentation file** ☑
- **Update [the documentation file](DOCUMENTATION.md)** ☑
- **Static functions** ☑
- **Randomized ```requests``` headers to avoid detectability when scraping** ☑
- **Different table formats (string or csv instead of pandas)** ☑ (ALREADY EXISTS)
- **Upload FBRefStats to PyPI** ☑

- **More scraping!** ☐\
There is so much data available on [FBRef], so I would love to add more methods so that this data can be accessed through the script

- **Add support for different league formats** ☐\
As of right now, there are very few leagues supported as I am yet to add functionality to leagues with different formats (promotion/relegation playoffs, MLS post-season, or Apertura/Clausura formats commonly found in Latin America)

- **Narrow down ```GeneralScraper.getPlayerLink()```** ☐\
Currently, ```GeneralScraper.getPlayerLink()``` takes one argument: ```inputted_player_name```. The method returns a list of URLs depending on which players were found when searching with ```inputted_player_name```. This can get annoying when there are many players with similar names, so adding a *nationality* argument, or any other similar optional arguments, would be useful for searching.
