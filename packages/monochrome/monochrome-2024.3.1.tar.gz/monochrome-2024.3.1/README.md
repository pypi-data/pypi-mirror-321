# Monochrome â€” Viewer for scientific monochromatic video data

Monochrome is a viewer for scientific monochromatic videos with high-dynamic range.

It is designed for viewing high-speed monochromatic fluorescence video data from scientific cameras and meet our spefic needs for cardiac optical mapping data (together with [optimap](https://github.com/cardiacvision/optimap)):
* Support for high-dynamic range (uint16, 32-bit float)
* Playback of multiple videos in sync
* High-speed playback with precise frame-rate control
* Viewing of optical traces (average intensity in a region of interest over time)
* Rendering of layers on top of videos with transparency
* Rendering of point positions over time (e.g. for tracking or optical flow visualization)
* Exporting of videos as PNG images or MP4 videos with precise control over the frame rate
* Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, MacOS)

It is designed to be fast and lightweight, i.e. it uses memory-mapping to load video files to avoid copying the data into RAM. 

## Standalone Application and Python Library

Monochrome can be used as a standalone application or as a Python library. The standalone application is a simple video viewer with a minimalistic user interface. The Python library allows to load and play videos from Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks, see the Python Quickstart section below.

For the standalone application, download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/sitic/monochrome/-/releases) and run the executable. On Winodws you may need to install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2019](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe).

For the Python library, install it with pip:

```bash
python -m pip install monochrome
```

## Native Video File Formats
Monochrome supports the following video file formats:

* `.npy` (NumPy array) with shape (time, width, height). The data type can be float, integer (uint8, uint16, etc.), or boolean.
* `.dat` (binary) with shape (time, width, height) and data type float32
* `.dat` MultiRecorder format

Drag & drop the file into the window or associate the file extension with Monochrome to open it with a double-click.

## Usage & Key Bindings

Click in a video to view optical traces (average intensity in a region of interest over time). Click and drag to move the region of interest. Right-click to remove the region of interest.

Keyboard shortcuts:

| Keybinding &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Action &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl + q` | Quit Monochrome |
| `Esc` or `q` | Close focused recording |
| `Space` | Play/Pause |
| `Up` | Increase playback speed (frame skip) |
| `Down` | Decrease playback speed (frame skip) |
| `0` or `r` | Reset playback to beginning |
| `Left` | Skip to next frame |
| `Right` | Skip to previous frame |
| `Shift + Left` | 10x previous frame |
| `Shift + Right` | 10x next frame |
| `Ctrl + Left` | Previous frame in focused recording only |
| `Ctrl + Right` | Next frame in focused recording only |
| `Ctrl + Left + Shift` | 10x previous frame in focused recording only |
| `Ctrl + Right + Shift` | 10x next frame in focused recording only |
| `p` | Save screenshot of focused recording |
| `s` | Sync playback of all recordings |

## Python Quickstart

To install Monochrome with Python integration run the following command on Linux or macOS:
```bash
python -m pip install monochrome
```
On Windows you might need to run
```bash
py -m pip install monochrome
```
The installation of the standalone Monochrome application is *not* required.


```python
import monochrome as mc
import numpy as np

# Load some video with shape (time, width, height)
video = np.random.rand((500, 128, 128))

# Play the video in a loop, name it "Our Test Video"
mc.show(video, "Our Test Video", cmap='viridis')

# The video is copied to Monochrome and will play in a loop.
# It plays independently from the python process, it does not block it.
# The playback speed etc. can be controlled in Monochrome, as well as the export as png images or as mp4 video

# Videos of type float or unsigned integer (uint8, uint16 etc.) are natively supported by Monochrome
video2 = (np.random.rand((500, 128, 128)) * 65535).astype(dtype=np.uint16)

# Several videos can be shown at the same time, they will be played in sync if they have the same length
mc.show(video2, "Another Video", cmap='gray', comment="Blebbistatin")

# Layers can be added on top of video.
# Pixels with value NaN are not displayed, instead the layer/video below is shown
overlay = np.random.rand((500, 128, 128))
overlay[32:96, 32:96] = np.nan

mc.show_layer(overlay, "Overlay Name", cmap='hsv', opacity='linear')

# By default, layers are added to the last video loaded, unless the parent name is specified.
mc.show_layer(overlay, "Phase", parent="Our Test Video", cmap='hsv')
```

## Development

### Dependencies

#### Linux

Install the following packages:
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake mesa-utils xorg-dev
```

#### MacOS

Download [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and Xcode.

#### Windows

Download [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and a C++ compiler like Microsoft Visual C++ or MinGW.

### Compilation

This project uses CMake to generate cross-platform build configurations. Either use cmake-gui or the terminal from the project folder (where CMakeList is located):

```bash
# Create a subfolder (generally called build)
mkdir build
cd build

# Generate a project for the default platform
cmake ..

# Alternatively display the available platforms and generate the project for the platform of your choice
cmake --help    # (optional)
cmake .. -G "Xcode"    # (example)
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"    # (example)
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"   # (example)

# Then use your IDE or use CMake to compile
cmake --build .

# Linux only: installation
sudo cmake --build . --target install
```
