Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- National number should be editable from the cooperator portal. Indeed, if the national number is required and was not provided on the first subscription, a cooperator will not be able to subscribe more shares from the website form.

=========

16.0.1.2.1 (2024-06-14)

- National register number is correctly pre-filled even when it is not required.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
