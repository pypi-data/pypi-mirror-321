[Embed a webview in tkinter](example/testtkinter.py)

[Embed a webview in win32 window](example/win32.py)

[Build a webview based app with react and PyQt](example/fluent/main.py)


### Specify library path


Wheel includes pre-built libraries of Windows/Linux/Macos, and libraries are placed at platform/{sys.platform}/{x86|x64}/webview. 

To specify a self-built library or use other platform's library, use api ```declare_library_path``` like this:

``` python
from webviewpy import declare_library_path
declare_library_path(
    r"C:\build\library\webview.dll"
)
```
