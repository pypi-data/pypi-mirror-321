# Uploady

**Version:** `0.0.2` (Equivalent to `0.7.1` of telegram-upload)

**Uploady** is a **fork** of the [Telegram Upload (Nekmo Fork)](https://github.com/Nekmo/telegram-upload) repository. It is designed to provide extended functionality for uploading and managing files on Telegram. This version is **currently in beta**, with exciting new features under development for the upcoming **0.1.0** release.

---

## 🚀 Features (Coming Soon)

**Uploady** aims to expand on the original functionality of **Telegram Upload** with the following features:

- **Bot Support**: Upload files directly using Telegram bots, making automation much simpler.
- **Multiple Clients**: Support for managing multiple Telegram client accounts for upload automation.
- **Scheduled Uploads**: Automatically upload files at specified times.
- **Gallery Sync**: Sync your local gallery with your Telegram account.
- **Auto Posting**: Automatically post content to channels at set intervals or specific times.

These features are still in development, and you can expect the full functionality in **version 0.1.0**, which is already in **beta testing** locally!

## 🧐 Why Uploady?

While **Telegram Upload** offers great features, **Uploady** takes it a step further by supporting:

- **Bots and multiple client accounts**, providing you with advanced automation capabilities.
- **Scheduled uploads**, giving you full control over when to upload content without manual intervention.
- **Gallery synchronization**, making it easier to keep your Telegram media up to date.
- **Auto posting** to your Telegram channels, enabling hands-off management.

With these additions, **Uploady** will become your ultimate solution for file uploads and management on Telegram.

## 👨‍💻 Acknowledgements

A **huge thank you** to **[Nekmo](https://github.com/Nekmo)**, whose work on the original **Telegram Upload** repository has made this project possible. His contributions have been instrumental in getting this project off the ground.

**Telethon** has been an essential part of this project, providing the foundation for Telegram API interactions. A special shout-out to **[Lonami](https://github.com/Lonami)** for the development of the **[Telethon library](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon)**, which powers the core functionality of Uploady. **Telethon** is a powerful Python Telegram client that allows for robust interactions with Telegram's API, making complex tasks like uploading and managing files effortless.

---

## 📅 Future Plans

- I initially considered adding support for **Pyrogram**, but since Pyrogram is no longer actively maintained, I'm waiting for a new fork created by a developer who is actively maintaining it. As soon as that's available, I will add support for **Pyrogram** as well.
- Full feature set integration is expected in **version 0.1.0**, which will include all the features currently in development.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

You can install **Uploady** via `pip`:

```bash
pip install uploady==0.0.2
````
