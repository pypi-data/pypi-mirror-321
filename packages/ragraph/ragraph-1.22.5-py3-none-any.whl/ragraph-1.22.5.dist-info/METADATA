# RaGraph

RaGraph is a package to create, manipulate, and analyze graphs consisting of nodes and edges. Nodes
usually represent (hierarchies of) objects and edges the dependencies or relationships between them.

These graphs, or networks if you will, lend themselves well to applied analyses like clustering and
sequencing, as well as analyses involving the calculation of various insightful metrics.

RaGraph is licensed following a dual licensing model. In short, we want to provide anyone that
wishes to use our published software under the GNU GPLv3 to do so freely and without any further
limitation. The GNU GPLv3 is a strong copyleft license that promotes the distribution of free,
open-source software. In that spirit, it requires dependent pieces of software to follow the same
route. This might be too restrictive for some. To accommodate users with specific requirements
regarding licenses, we offer a proprietary license. The terms can be discussed by reaching out to
