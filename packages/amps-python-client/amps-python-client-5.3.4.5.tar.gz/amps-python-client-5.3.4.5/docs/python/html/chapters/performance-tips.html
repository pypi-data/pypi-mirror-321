<h1>13. Performance Tips and Best Practices<a class="headerlink" href="#performance-tips-and-best-practices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This chapter presents tips and techniques for writing high-performance
applications with AMPS. This section presents principles and approaches
that describe how to use the features of AMPS and the AMPS client
libraries to achieve high performance and reliability.</p>
<p>Specific techniques (for example, the details on how to write a message
handler) are described in other parts of the AMPS documentation and
referenced here. Other techniques require information specific to the
application (for example, determining the minimum set of information
required in a message), and are best done as part of your application
design.</p>
<p>All of the recommendations in this section are general guidelines. There
are few, if any, universal rules for performance: at times, a design
decision that is absolutely necessary to meet the requirements for an
application might reduce performance somewhat. For example, your
application might involve sending large binary data that cannot be
incrementally updated. That application will use more bandwidth per
message than an application that sends 100-byte messages with fields
that can be incrementally updated. However, since the application
depends on being able to deliver the binary payloads, this difference in
bandwidth consumption is a part of the requirements for the application,
not a design decision that can be optimized.</p>
<div class="section" id="measure-performance-and-set-goals">
<h2>Measure Performance and Set Goals<a class="headerlink" href="#measure-performance-and-set-goals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The most important tools for creating high performance applications that
use AMPS are clear goals and accurate measurement. Without accurate
measurement, it&#8217;s impossible to know whether a particular change has
improved performance or not. Without clear goals, it&#8217;s difficult to know
whether a given result is sufficient, or whether you need to continue
improving performance.</p>
<p>60East recommends that your measurements include baseline metrics for
the part of your message processing that does not involve AMPS. As an
example, imagine your task is to reduce the amount of time that elapses
between when an order is sent and when the processed response is
received from 100ms in total to 85ms in total. To achieve this
reduction, you might first measure the processing that your application
performs on the order. If that processing consumes 65ms, the most
effective optimization may be to improve the order processing. On the
other hand, if processing an order consumes 15ms, then optimizing
message delivery or network utilization may be the most effective way to
meet your goals.</p>
<p>When measuring performance, simulate your production environment as
closely as possible. For example, AMPS is highly parallelized, so
sending a pattern of subscriptions and publishes from a single test
client that would normally come from 20 clients will produce a very
different performance profile. Likewise, AMPS can typically perform at
rates that fill the available bandwidth. Performance measured on a 1GbE
connection may be very different than performance measured over a 10GbE
connection. Consider the characteristics of your data, and the number of
messages you expect to store and process. A 1GB data set consisting of 1
million records will perform differently than a 1GB data set consisting
of 10 million records, or a 1GB data set consisting of 100 records.</p>
<p>When collecting information about performance, 60East recommends
enabling persistence for the Statistics Database (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stats.db</span></code>), so you
can easily collect historical data on both AMPS and the operating
system. For example, a dip in performance correlated with high CPU and
memory usage at the same time each day may be correlated with other
activity on the system (such as cron jobs or close of business
processing). In a situation like that, where the performance reduction
is based on factors external to the AMPS application, the overall system
metrics captured in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stats.db</span></code> can help you re-create the external
state and understand the state of the system as a whole. AMPS collects
the statistics in memory by default, and persisting that data into a
database does not typically have a measurable effect on performance
itself, but makes measuring and tuning performance much easier.</p>
<p>For performance testing, 60East recommends using dedicated hardware for
AMPS to eliminate the effects of other processes. If dedicated hardware
is not available and other processes are consuming resources, 60East
recommends disabling AMPS NUMA tuning to ensure that AMPS threads do not
unnecessarily compete with other processes during performance tuning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-haclient-and-heartbeating-where-appropriate">
<h2>Use HAClient and Heartbeating Where Appropriate<a class="headerlink" href="#use-haclient-and-heartbeating-where-appropriate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Not every application that uses AMPS requires high availability and the
ability to automatically fail over if connectivity is lost or an instance
of AMPS is offline. For applications that do need automatic reconnection,
60East strongly recommends using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HAClient</span></code> and setting heartbeating
for the client to effectively detect disconnection.</p>
<p>When using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HAClient</span></code> and heartbeating, there are two important
guidelines to follow:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Do not replace the disconnect handler on the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HAClient</span></code>. The
disconnect handler is responsible for reconnection, resubscription, and
so on. If you need to detect disconnection, use a connection state listener.</li>
<li>Set the interval for heartbeating to approximately one-half the time
that the application can tolerate interruption in message flow. Notice
that it&#8217;s not possible for the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HAClient</span></code> to tell the difference
between an interruption in message flow caused by a server going offline
and interruptions caused by an increase in latency due to network
saturation or so on, so the interval should be somewhat larger than the
highest expected latency between AMPS and the application. Last, but
not least, if the application uses asynchronous message handling, the
interval should also be set to a value larger than the maximum amount
of time expected for the message handler to process a single message.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="simplify-message-format-and-contents">
<h2>Simplify Message Format and Contents<a class="headerlink" href="#simplify-message-format-and-contents" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>AMPS supports a wide range of message types, and is capable of filtering
and processing large and complex messages. For many applications, the
simplicity of being able to use messages that contain the full
information is the most important consideration. For other applications,
however, achieving the minimum possible latency and the maximum possible
network utilization is important enough to warrant choosing a simplified
message format.</p>
<p>To simplify message contents, carefully consider the information that
downstream processors require. If a downstream process will not use
information in the message, there is no need to send the information.
For example, consider an application that provides orders from a UI. In
such an application, the object that represents the order often contains
information relevant to the local state of the application that is not
relevant to a downstream system. Rather than simply serializing the full
object, your application may perform better if you serialize only the
fields that a downstream system will take action on.</p>
<p>To simplify message format, choose the simplest format that can convey
the information that your application needs. The general principle is
that the simpler the message format is, the more quickly AMPS and client
libraries can parse messages of that type. Likewise, the more
complicated the structure of each message is, the more work is required
to parse the message. For the highest levels of performance, 60East
recommends keeping the message structure simple and preferring message
formats such as NVFIX, BFlat, or flattened JSON (structured as key/value
pairs) as compared with more complicated formats such as XML or BSON.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="measure-serialization-and-deserialization">
<h2>Measure Serialization and Deserialization<a class="headerlink" href="#measure-serialization-and-deserialization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When creating baseline performance numbers, measure
serialization and deserialization performance independent
of the AMPS server or client libraries.</p>
<p>This can help you to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Understand the baseline performance of creating
and processing message data under ideal conditions
(that is, where there is no application processing,
networking, routing, etc. involved).</li>
<li>Easily compare the application-side performance of
different message formats or different message
layouts within a single format.</li>
</ul>
<p>When testing this performance, it is helpful to
use data similar to the data that the application
will actually process during a business day, at
the volumes the application would typically
process. This will help you understand the
performance of serialization and deserialization
for this specific application. For example,
a library for working with a given message format
might be less efficient when processing
messages with a large number of string fields in
a deeply-nested structure, but your application
might exchange only numeric data in a relatively flat
structure. Likewise, the library for a given format
could be efficient for processing a small number of
fields, but have lower performance for a message
type with hundreds of fields.</p>
<p>As with all performance testing, the more closely
the test environment matches the actual data
and volumes of a production environment, the
more helpful those measurements will be for
understanding system performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-content-filtering-where-possible">
<h2>Use Content Filtering Where Possible<a class="headerlink" href="#use-content-filtering-where-possible" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>AMPS content filtering helps your application perform better by ensuring
that your application only receives the messages that it needs. Wherever
possible, we recommend using content filtering to precisely specify
which messages your application needs. In particular, if at any point
your application is receiving a message, parsing the message, and then
determining whether to act on the message or not, 60East recommends
using content filters to ensure that your application only receives
messages that it needs to act on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-asynchronous-message-processing">
<h2>Use Asynchronous Message Processing<a class="headerlink" href="#use-asynchronous-message-processing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The synchronous message processing interface is straightforward, and
presents a convenient interface for getting started with AMPS.</p>
<p>However, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MessageStream</span></code> used by the synchronous interface makes a
full copy of each message and provides it from the background reader
thread to the thread that consumes the message. This memory overhead and
synchronization between the reader thread and consumer thread happens
regardless of whether the application needs all of the header fields in
the message or even processes the message. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MessageStream</span></code> also
does not take into account the speed at which your program is consuming
messages, and will read messages into memory as fast as the network and
processor allow. If your application cannot consume messages at wire
speed, this can lead to increasing memory consumption as the application
falls further behind the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MessageStream</span></code>.</p>
<p>Most applications see improved performance by using a
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MessageHandler</span></code>. With this approach, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MessageHandler</span></code> does
minimal work. If more extensive processing is needed, the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MessageHandler</span></code> dispatches the work to another thread: but it does
this only when the work is necessary, and it only saves the part of the
message needed to accomplish the work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-hash-indexes-where-possible-for-sow-queries">
<h2>Use Hash Indexes Where Possible for SOW Queries<a class="headerlink" href="#use-hash-indexes-where-possible-for-sow-queries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When querying a SOW, hash indexes on SOW topics are supported for exact
matching on string data as described in the <em>AMPS User Guide</em>. A hash
index can perform many times faster than a parallel query. If the query
pattern for your application can take advantage of hash indexes, 60East
recommends creating those hash indexes on your SOW topics.</p>
<p>More recent versions of AMPS can use hash indexes for a wider variety of
filters. When planning your queries, review the SOW queries section of
the <em>AMPS User Guide</em> for the version you are using for guidelines on
the optimizations available in that version.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-a-failed-write-handler-and-exception-listener">
<h2>Use a Failed Write Handler and Exception Listener<a class="headerlink" href="#use-a-failed-write-handler-and-exception-listener" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In many cases, particularly during the early stages of development,
performance problems can point to defects in the application. Even after
the application is tuned, monitoring for failure is important to keep
applications running smoothly.</p>
<p>60East recommends always installing a failed write handler if your
application is publishing messages. This will help you to quickly
identify cases where AMPS is rejecting publishes due to entitlement
failures, message type mismatches, or other similar problems.</p>
<p>60East recommends always installing an exception listener if your
application is using asynchronous message processing. This will help you
to identify and correct any problems with your message handler. An
exception listener should typically log the message received
and return.  If recovery is needed, the listener should set a
flag for another thread to process rather than attempting to
recover on the thread that calls the exception listener.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reduce-bandwidth-requirements">
<h2>Reduce Bandwidth Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#reduce-bandwidth-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In many applications that use AMPS, network bandwidth is the single most
important factor in overall performance. Your application can use
bandwidth most efficiently by reducing message size. For example, rather
than serializing an entire object, you might serialize only the fields
that the remote process needs to act on, as mentioned above. Likewise,
rather than sending one message that contains a collected set of
information that processors will need to extract, consider sending a
message in the units that processors will work with. This can reduce
bandwidth to processors substantially. For example, rather than sending
a single message with all of the activity for a single customer over a
given period of time (such as a trading day), consider breaking out the
record into the individual transactions for the customer.</p>
<div class="section" id="tune-batch-size-for-sow-queries">
<h3>Tune Batch Size for SOW Queries<a class="headerlink" href="#tune-batch-size-for-sow-queries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As described in the section on <a class="reference external" href="../../../python/html/chapters/sow.html#setting-batch-size">SOW batch size</a>, tuning the batch size for
SOW queries can improve overall performance by improving network
utilization. In addition, because the AMPS header is only parsed once
per batch, a larger batch size can dramatically improve processing
performance for smaller messages.</p>
<p>The AMPS clients default to a batch size of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">10</span></code>. This provides
generally good performance for most transactional messages (such as
order records or inventory records). For large messages, particularly
messages greater than a megabyte in size, a batch size of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></code> may
reduce memory pressure in the client and improve performance.</p>
<p>With smaller messages (for example, message sizes of a few hundred
bytes), 60East recommends measuring performance with larger batch sizes
such as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">50</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">100</span></code>. For large messages, reducing the batch size
may improve overall performance by requiring less memory consumption on
the AMPS server.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conflate-fast-changing-information">
<h3>Conflate Fast-Changing Information<a class="headerlink" href="#conflate-fast-changing-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If your data source publishes information faster than your clients need
to consume it, consider using a conflated topic. For example, in a
system that presents a user interface and displays fast-moving data, it
is common for the data to change at a rate faster than the user
interface can format and render the data. In this case, a conflated
topic can both reduce bandwidth and simplify processing in the user
interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="minimize-bandwidth-for-updates">
<h3>Minimize Bandwidth for Updates<a class="headerlink" href="#minimize-bandwidth-for-updates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If your application uses a SOW and processes frequent updates, consider
using delta publish and delta subscribe to reduce the size of the
messages transmitted. These features are designed to minimize bandwidth
while still providing full-fidelity data streams.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conflate-queue-acknowledgments">
<h3>Conflate Queue Acknowledgments<a class="headerlink" href="#conflate-queue-acknowledgments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The AMPS clients include the ability to conflate acknowledgments back
to AMPS as queue messages are processed. Using these features, with an
appropriate <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">max_backlog</span></code>, can reduce the amount of network traffic
required for acknowledgments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-a-transaction-log-when-monitoring-publish-failures">
<h3>Use a Transaction Log When Monitoring Publish Failures<a class="headerlink" href="#use-a-transaction-log-when-monitoring-publish-failures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When a topic is not covered by a transaction log, AMPS returns
acknowledgment messages for every publish that requests one. This
ensures that each message is acknowledged, even when AMPS has no
persistent record of the messages in the topic. However, acknowledging
each message requires more network traffic for each publish message.</p>
<p>When a topic is covered by a transaction log, AMPS conflates persisted
acknowledgments. Conflation is possible in this case because AMPS has a
full record of the messages and does not have to store additional state
to conflate the acknowledgments. With conflated acknowledgments, AMPS
will send a success acknowledgment periodically that covers all
messages up to that point. If a message fails, AMPS immediately sends
the conflated success acknowledgment for all previous messages and the
failure acknowledgment for the failed message.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="combine-conflation-and-deltas">
<h3>Combine Conflation and Deltas<a class="headerlink" href="#combine-conflation-and-deltas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In many cases, using an approach that combines delta publishes to a SOW
with delta subscriptions to a conflated topic can dramatically reduce
bandwidth to the application with no loss of information.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="limit-unnecessary-copies">
<h2>Limit Unnecessary Copies<a class="headerlink" href="#limit-unnecessary-copies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the most effective ways to increase performance is to limit the
amount of data copied within your application.</p>
<p>For example, if your message handler submits work to a set of processors
that only use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Data</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Bookmark</span></code> from a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Message</span></code>, create a
data structure that holds only those fields and copy that information
into instances of that data structure rather than copying the entire
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Message</span></code>. While this approach requires a few extra lines of code, the
performance benefits can be substantial.</p>
<p>When publishing messages to AMPS, avoid unnecessary copies of the data.
For example, if you have the data in a byte array, use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">publish</span></code>
methods that use a byte array rather than converting the data to a
string unnecessarily. Likewise, if you have the data in the form of a
string, avoid converting it to a byte array where possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="manage-publish-stores">
<h2>Manage Publish Stores<a class="headerlink" href="#manage-publish-stores" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When using a publish store, the Client holds messages until they are
acknowledged as persisted by AMPS, as determined by the replication
configuration for the AMPS instance.</p>
<p>In the event that an instance with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync</span></code> replication goes offline,
the publish store for the Client will grow, since the messages are not
being fully persisted. To avoid this problem, 60East recommends that an
instance that uses <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync</span></code> replication always configure Actions to
automatically downgrade the replication link if the remote instance goes
offline for a period of time, and upgrade the link when the remote
instance comes back online.</p>
<p>Further, 60East recommends that, where possible, a publisher is
provisioned with enough storage to hold its complete publish stream
for the amount of time that a destination may be offline or
unavailable without downgrading from <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync</span></code> replication to
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">async</span></code> replication. For example, if the server considers a downstream
system to be unreachable if it has not acknowledged a replicated message
in 60 seconds, and the server checks this threshold every 10 seconds,
then a publisher should plan that, at any time, the publisher may need
to retain approximately 70 seconds worth of published messages. This is
calculated as the 60 seconds threshold that the server has established for a
destination to run behind, plus the 10 second interval at which the server
checks whether the destination is within the threshold. Also notice
that, with a configuration like this, a downstream replication destination
could run as much as 59 seconds behind indefinitely. A publisher should
be provisioned to be able to run effectively in a &#8220;worst case&#8221; (or nearly
&#8220;worst case&#8221;) scenario for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>See the <em>High Availability and Replication</em> chapter in the <em>AMPS User Guide</em>
for more information on replication, sync and async acknowledgment
modes, and the Actions used to manage replication.</p>

<div class="section" id="use-the-server-logs-to-help-troubleshoot">
<h2>Use the Server Logs to Help Troubleshoot<a class="headerlink" href="#use-the-server-logs-to-help-troubleshoot" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When troubleshooting problems with an application that uses AMPS, the
server-side logs often provide the most helpful information. For example,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trace</span></code> level logging shows the data that is flowing through AMPS.
Log messages at <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">info</span></code> level show events as incoming connections,
commands from clients, and so on. When questions arise about how the server
and application interact, the server logs often contain the information.</p>
<p>60East recommends that an AMPS instance used for development and testing
log at <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trace</span></code> level, and that a server used for production log at
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">info</span></code> level, with the ability to log at <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trace</span></code> level when necessary
for investigating any problems that may arise.</p>
<p>When a command does not have the expected result, or an application
reports an error, the fastest way to understand the problem is often
to review the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trace</span></code> level logging for the instance.  See the
<em>AMPS User Guide</em> for details on configuring logging and common
patterns for searching for information in AMPS logs.</p>
