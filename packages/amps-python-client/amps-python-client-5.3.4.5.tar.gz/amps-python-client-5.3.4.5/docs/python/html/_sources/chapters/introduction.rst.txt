1. Introduction
===============

This document explains how to use the Python client for AMPS. Use this
document to learn how to install, configure and develop applications
using the AMPS Python client API.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before reading this guide, it is important to have a good understanding
of the following topics:

-  **Developing in Python** - To be successful using this guide, you will
   need to possess a working knowledge of the Python language. Visit
   http://www.python.org for resources on learning Python.

-  **AMPS Concepts** - Before reading this guide, you will need to understand
   the basic concepts of AMPS, such as *topics*, *subscriptions*,
   *messages* and *SOW*. Consult the *AMPS User Guide* to learn more
   about these topics before proceeding.

-  **An Installed Python Interpreter** - The AMPS Python client currently
   supports Python version 2.7 or greater, including Python 3.

-  **Python setuptools** - This is included with many Python distributions.
   If it is not already installed on your system, you must add
   setuptools to your installation. See
   https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/setuptools.html 
   for information on setuptools.
   
60East also provides precompiled ``.egg`` files for both Linux and Windows.
These files target specific versions of Python, as indicated in the filenames.

If you are running on a different system or using a different version of
Python, you will also need:

-  **Python distutils** - Most Python installations contain this package by
   default.

-  **C++ Compiler** - To build the client, you will need a C++ compiler as
   described in the Python Support section below. This is only necessary
   for initial installation. You do not need a C++ compiler to run the client.

You will need an installed and running AMPS server to use the product as
well. You can write and compile programs that use AMPS without a running
server, but you will get the most out of this guide by running the
programs against a working server.
