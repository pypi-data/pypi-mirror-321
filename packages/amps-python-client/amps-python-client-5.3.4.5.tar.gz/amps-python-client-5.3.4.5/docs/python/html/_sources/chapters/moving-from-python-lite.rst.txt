14. Migrating from Earlier Python Implementations
=================================================

The AMPS Python client builds on the AMPS C++ client to provide all of
the features of the C++ client at high performance. 60East previously
produced a different implementation of a Python client, which is now
deprecated.

The AMPS Python client is fully-compatible with the previous
implementation. This client also adds support for:

-  High availability clients

-  Bookmark subscriptions

-  Features added after AMPS 3.5

The earlier implementation did not fully follow the style guidelines in
Python Enhancement Proposal 8 (PEP 8). Functions and objects in the
previous implementation were named with camel case style, while
functions and objects in the Python client follow the standard Python
convention of lowercase words separated by underscores.

The Python client contains compatibility functions for the previous
implementation. To update your code to follow PEP 8 conventions, replace
camel case functions with the equivalent. For example, the
``sowAndSubscribe`` function in your code becomes ``sow_and_subscribe``
with the Python client.

Since camel case style functions are provided for compatibility, there
are no camel case style functions for features that weren't included in
the previous implementation.
