Get the Equipment
=================

To get the most out of your evaluation, you will need:

1. An installation of AMPS on a Linux host

   * An Linux installation and a local installation of AMPS.

     * If you do not already have a Linux installation, you can use a virtual machine, for example, VirtualBox available at http://virtualbox.org
     * Make sure that Virtualization Technology is enabled on your development machine, as described at http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1003944
     * Create a Virtual Machine with enough memory and disk space to hold the data you intend to use with your AMPS evaluation
     * Install the Linux distribution of your choice 
     * Download the AMPS Linux distribution at http://crankuptheamps.com/evaluation


2. The AMPS Python Client (which this file is part of). Visit crankuptheamps.com to download the latest kits and documents.
