static const char* amps_message_class_docs =
  "AMPS.Message represents a single message sent to or received from the "
  "AMPS server. The class provides methods for every header that can be "
  "present, whether or not that header will be populated or used in a "
  "particular context.\n\n"
  "Applications typically use an :class:`AMPS.Command` to create outgoing "
  "requests to AMPS, and receive instances of :class:`AMPS.Message` in "
  "response.\n\n"
  "The AMPS Command Reference provides details on which headers are used "
  "by AMPS and which will be populated on messages received from AMPS, "
  "depending on the command the :class:`AMPS.Message` responds to, the options"
  "and headers set on that command, and the type of the response message.\n\n"
  ":class:`AMPS.Message` has been designed to minimize unnecessary memory "
  "allocation. Copying a Message does not copy the underlying content "
  "of the message. When the AMPS client provides a Message to a "
  "message handler function, the data in that Message is a region "
  "in the buffer that the AMPS client uses to read from the socket. If your "
  "application will use the Message after the message handler returns, "
  "you should use the :func:`__deepcopy__()` function to "
  "copy the underlying data as well as the Message, since in this case the "
  "AMPS client will reuse the underlying buffer once the MessageHandler "
  "returns. See the AMPS Python Developer Guide section on asynchronous "
  "message processing for more details.\n\n"
  "If your application has the need to bypass most of the :class:`AMPS.Client` "
  "infrastructure for some reason when sending commands to AMPS, the "
  ":class:`AMPS.Message` / :func:`AMPS.Client.send()` interface provides the "
  "flexibility to do so. In return, your application must provide "
  "functionality that is normally provided automatically by the "
  ":class:`AMPS.Client` (for example, tracking subscriptions for failover, "
  "recording the message in the publish store and managing success or "
  "failure of the publish, and so on). Although this functionality is "
  "available for flexibility, it is rarely needed in practice. 60East "
  "recommends using :class:`AMPS.Command` objects with "
  ":func:`AMPS.Client.execute()` and "
  ":func:`AMPS.Client.execute_async()` for sending commands to AMPS.\n\n" ;
