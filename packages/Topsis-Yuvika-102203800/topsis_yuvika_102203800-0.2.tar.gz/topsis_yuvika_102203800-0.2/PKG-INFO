# Topsis_Yuvika_102203800

This is a Python package for implementing the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). It is a popular multi-criteria decision-making method used to rank alternatives based on their relative closeness to the ideal solution.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install Topsis_Yuvika_102203800
```

## Usage

### Input File Format

The input CSV file must follow this structure:

- The first column contains the names of the alternatives (e.g., products, models, or options).
- Subsequent columns contain the numerical values of the criteria for each alternative.
- The first row should provide headers for all columns.
-There must be at least three columns
- All criteria values should be numerical.
- The number of weights and impacts should match the number of criteria columns.
- Impacts must only include + (beneficial) or - (non-beneficial).


### Command-line Usage

After installation, you can use the `topsis` command in the terminal:

```bash
topsis <input_file> <weights> <impacts> <output_file>
````

- `<input_file>`: Path to the input CSV file.
- `<weights>`: Comma-separated string of weights for the criteria.
- `<impacts>`: Comma-separated string of '+' or '-' indicating the desirability of the criteria.
- `<output_file>`: Path to the output CSV file to save the results.

## Example

```bash
topsis data.csv "0.5,0.3,0.2" "+,-,+" results.csv
```

This command will process the `data.csv` file using the specified weights and impacts and output the results to `results.csv`.
