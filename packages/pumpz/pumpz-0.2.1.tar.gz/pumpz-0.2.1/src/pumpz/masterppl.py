    Master PPL file handler for controlling multiple syringe pumps.
    
    This class manages multiple pump configurations through a master PPL file,
    allowing coordinated control of multiple pumps with different addresses.
    
    Attributes:
        file: File object for writing PPL commands
        adrs (list): List of pump addresses being controlled
        
    Example:
        >>> with open('master.ppl', 'w') as master_file:
        ...     master = masterppl(master_file)
        ...     master.add(1, pump1)
        ...     master.add(2, pump2)
        ...     master.quickset({1: pump1, 2: pump2})
