# DJICOT: DJI Drone Detection, Tracking & Identification with TAK

## Overview

DJICOT is a tool for monitoring and analyzing DJI OcuSync Drone ID sUAS data within the 
Team Awareness Kit (TAK) ecosystem. It enables geolocating, detection, tracking, and 
identification of drones using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment. DJICOT 
supports rapid deployment into a C-UAS processing chain and integrates seamlessly into 
existing common operating picture and situational awareness systems.
