# ysoisochrone

`ysoisochrone` is a `Python3` package that handles the isochrones for young-stellar-objects. One of the primary goals of this package is to derive the stellar mass and ages from the isochrones.

## Feature 

- Handle different formats of the isochrones from different reference sources. The available evolutionary models include [Baraffe et al. (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...577A..42B/abstract), [Feiden (2016)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...593A..99F/abstract), and [PARSEC (both version 1.2 and 2.0)](http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/PARSEC/index.html). Other tracks will also be added in the future.
- Derive the stellar masses and ages from the isochrones by:
	- (a) Using the Bayesian inference approach. The required inputs are stellar effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$), bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$), and their uncertainties.
	- (b) Using the Bayesian inference approach where we do not have a good luminosity measurement. Therefore, we need to assume an age for the target.
	- (c) Using a simple approach to estimate the stellar masses and ages from the grid point that has the closest $T_{\rm eff}$ and $L_{\rm bol}$ to the target.
- Basic plot utils to show Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, Bayesian inference results and others.

## Installation

First download the package release from the GitHub page. Then unzip the package.

In the terminal and in the directory of this package where `setup.py` exists.

```bash 
pip install .
```

## Quick Start

A [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/DingshanDeng/ysoisochrone/blob/main/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial1_quick_start.ipynb) is provided as a `Jupyter Notebook` together with other [tutorial `Jupyter Notebooks`](https://github.com/DingshanDeng/ysoisochrone/tree/main/tutorial_notebooks). You can also find these tutorial notebooks in the folder called `tutorial_notebooks`.
