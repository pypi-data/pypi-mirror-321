[![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/ai2-kit)](https://pypi.org/project/ai2-kit/)


A toolkit featured _**a**rtificial **i**ntelligence Ã— **a**b **i**nitio_ for computational chemistry research.

*Please be advised that `ai2-kit` is still under heavy development and you should expect things to change often. We encourage people to play and explore with `ai2-kit`, and stay tuned with us for more features to come.*


## Feature Highlights
* Collection of tools to facilitate the development of automated workflows for computational chemistry research.
* Utilities to execute and manage jobs in local or remote HPC job scheduler.
* Utilities to simplified automated workflows development with reusable components. 

## Installation

You can use the following command to install `ai2-kit`:

```bash
# for users who just use most common features
pip install ai2-kit

# for users who want to use all features
pip install ai2-kit[all]
```

If you want to run `ai2-kit` from source, you can run the following commands in the project folder:

```bash
pip install poetry
# If you meet ConnectionError:
# poetry config installer.max-workers 4
poetry install

./ai2-kit --help
```
Note that instead of running global `ai2-kit` command, you should run `./ai2-kit` to run the command from source on Linux/MacOS or `.\ai2-kit.ps1` on Windows.
