# Moneyline 
Moneyline is a python package meant to help detect arbitrage opportunities in sports (only for moneyline bets). It has the following functions:
fetch_and_process_ml_data(api_key, sports, regions), where the api key is a string, and sports and regions are lists of strings; returns df

group_event_ml(df)

find_arb_ml(result_df)

Run these functions sequentially to get the final dataframe that is structured to detect arbitrage and non-arbitrage opportunities


for spreads an totals follow the exact same sequence of functions, but call:

fetch_and_process_spreads_totals_data(api_key, sports, regions)

group_event_spreads_totals(df)

find_arb_spreads_totals(df)

## Installation 
```bash 
pip install moneyline
