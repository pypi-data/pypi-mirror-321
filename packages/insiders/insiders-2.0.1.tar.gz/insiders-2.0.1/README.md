Manage your Insiders projects.

## Installation

```bash
pip install insiders
```

With [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv tool install insiders
```

## Usage

The `insiders` tool provides several commands that will help you manage projects based on a sponsorware strategy.

- `insiders backlog`: Print a backlog of issues, ordered using your own defined criteria
- `insiders index`: Serve a PyPI-like index locally, and upload private Insiders packages to it.
- `insiders project`: Bootstrap public/insiders project pairs on GitHub.
- `insiders pypi`: Register names on PyPI.
- `insiders team`: Grant/revoke access to a private GitHub organization team to/from your sponsors.

More documentation will be added later, for now ask @pawamoy for details (see where I can be reached on my profile) ðŸ™‚
