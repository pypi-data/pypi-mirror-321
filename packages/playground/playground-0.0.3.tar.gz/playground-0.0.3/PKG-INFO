# MuJoCo Playground

![Banner for playground](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_playground/blob/main/assets/banner.png?raw=true)


A comprehensive suite of GPU-accelerated environments for robot learning research and sim-to-real, built with [MuJoCo MJX](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/tree/main/mjx).

Features include:

- Classic control environments from `dm_control` reimplemented in MJX.
- Quadruped and bipedal locomotion environments.
- Non-prehensile and dexterous manipulation environments.
- Vision-based support available via [Madrona-MJX](https://github.com/shacklettbp/madrona_mjx).

For more details, check out the project [website](https://playground.mujoco.org/).

## Installation

You can install MuJoCo Playground directly from PyPI:

```sh
pip install playground
```

### From Source

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires Python 3.10 or later.

1. `pip install -U "jax[cuda12]"`
    * Verify GPU backend: python -c "import jax; print(jax.default_backend())" should print gpu
2. `git clone git@github.com:google-deepmind/mujoco_playground.git`
3. `cd mujoco_playground`
4. `uv pip install -e ".[all]"`

#### Madrona-MJX (optional)

For vision-based environments, please refer to the installation instructions in the [Madrona-MJX](https://github.com/shacklettbp/madrona_mjx?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) repository.

## Getting started

To try out MuJoCo Playground locally on a simple locomotion environment, you can run the following:

```py
import jax
import jax.numpy as jp
from mujoco_playground import registry

env = registry.load('Go1JoystickFlatTerrain')
state = jax.jit(env.reset)(jax.random.PRNGKey(0))
print(state.obs)
state = jax.jit(env.step)(state, jp.zeros(env.action_size))
print(state.obs)
```

For tutorials on MuJoCo Playground with Madrona-MJX batch rendering, we offer two types of colabs. The first allows you to install Madrona-MJX directly in a GPU colab instance and run vision-based cartpole!

1. [Training CartPole from Vision](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco_playground/blob/main/learning/notebooks/training_vision_1_t4.ipynb) on a Colab T4 Instance [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco_playground/blob/main/learning/notebooks/training_vision_1_t4.ipynb)

Two additional colabs require local runtimes with Madrona-MJX installed locally (see [Madrona-MJX](https://github.com/shacklettbp/madrona_mjx?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for installation instructions):
