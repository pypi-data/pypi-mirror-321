Students and lecturers alike are worried about global warming and related climate change.
With a clear ecological conscience and convinced that they stand on the right side of history,
they cycle to their university campus, buy a vegetarian sandwich on the way
and were jointly outraged when Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement.
However, their own contribution to climate change is all too often ignored.
This is an example from rst-workbench.
