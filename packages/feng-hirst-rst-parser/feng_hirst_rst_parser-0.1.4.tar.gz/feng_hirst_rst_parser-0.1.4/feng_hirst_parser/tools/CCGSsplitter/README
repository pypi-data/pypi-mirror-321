The program sentence_boundary.pl takes as an input a text file, and generates as
output another text file in which each line contains only one sentence. Blank
lines in the input file are considered to make the end of paragraphs, and are
still present in the output file. It requires a honorifics file as an argument.
A sample honorifics file is provided. This file MUST contain honorifics, not
abbreviations. The program detects abbreviations using regular expressions.

To use it, type

sentence_boundary.pl -d HONORIFICS -i input_file -o output_file
