# ThermoEngine(Lite) Python package
For a fully functional thermoengine installation see https://enki-portal.gitlab.io/ThermoEngine/.

This is a work in progress... please be patient as we refactor thermoengine to enable local installation on all major architectures. The most up-to-date versions in this process will be posted here. For updates on the project see http://www.enki-portal.org.

Modules in this package are documented at https://enki-portal.gitlab.io/ThermoEngine/, and use case examples may be found within the Notebooks folder located at the project root.


## Testing
This package includes a complete set of user tests implemented in pytest. To run the tests issue the following command from the package directory (where this file is located).

'pytest'

All tests should pass or xfail, validating that your installation is fully functional.
