## SigmoidNN

# Overview

This Library implements a simple yet powerful **neural network** using scary mathematical operations, such as the sigmoid activation function, cross-entropy loss, and matrix operationsðŸ˜–. The network has been tested with the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits and achieved an **97.99% accuracy** with the chosen parameters.

You can customize the layers, activation functions, and data to train and test the network for your specific needs.
