class Session:
    """
    Represents a session for managing transactions with a resource. Sessions are used
    to group multiple operations into a single transaction that can be committed or
    rolled back as a unit.

    Custom exception handlers can be registered to handle specific exceptions that
    occur during the session to avoid rolling back the transaction. This is useful
    for example for early stopping in loops.

    Attributes:
        *args: Variable length argument list with resource instances. 

    Methods:
        begin(self) -> None:
            Begins a transaction with the resource.

        commit(self) -> None:
            Commits the current transaction with the resource.

        rollback(self) -> None:
            Rolls back the current transaction with the resource.

        close(self) -> None:
            Closes the session and releases the resource.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

        from pybondi import Session
        
        with Session(repository, publisher, logger) as session:
            repository.add(model)
