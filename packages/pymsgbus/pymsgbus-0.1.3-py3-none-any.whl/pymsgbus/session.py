"""
This module is a framework for managing transactions across multiple resources, inspired by the
SQLAlchemy library. It provides a mechanism for coordinating transactional operations, ensuring
data integrity and reliability in complex workflows.

The core concept of this module is the `Session` class, which represents a session for managing
transactions with one or more resources. Sessions are used to group multiple operations into a
single transaction that can be committed or rolled back as a unit. Custom exception handlers can
be registered to handle specific exceptions that occur during the session to avoid rolling back
the transaction. This is useful for early stopping in loops or other scenarios where an exception
is expected and should not cause the transaction to fail.

In order to use the `Session` class, you need to define a resource that implements the `Resource`
interface. Resources are objects that can handle transactions and provide access to data or services.

    Represents a session for managing transactions with a resource. Sessions are used

    Custom exception handlers can be registered to handle specific exceptions that
    occur during the session to avoid rolling back the transaction. This is useful

    Attributes:
        *args: Variable length argument list with resource instances. 

    Methods:
        begin(self) -> None:
            Begins a transaction with the resource.

        commit(self) -> None:
            Commits the current transaction with the resource.

        rollback(self) -> None:
            Rolls back the current transaction with the resource.

        close(self) -> None:
            Closes the session and releases the resource.
