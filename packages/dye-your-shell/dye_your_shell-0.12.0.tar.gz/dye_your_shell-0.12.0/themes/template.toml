# to work whether it's a light mode theme or a dark mode theme
# so we use "more" and "less" to indicate more or less contrast
#
# that way
#     {{color.foreground}} on {{color.background_more}}
# will always have more contrast than
#     {{color.foreground}} on {{color.background_less}}
# and
#     {{color.foreground_more}} on {{color.background}}
# will always have more contrast than
#     {{color.foreground_less}} on {{color.background}}

## named colors
##
# everything on the lefthand side here should have a value assigned
# these are the 12 colors in an RGB color wheel
# primary colors: red, yellow, blue
# secondary colors: cyan, magenta, yellow
# tertiary colors: orange, chartreuse_green, spring_green,
#                  azure, violet, rose
#
# there is not universal alignment with the names of these colors
# we use the names from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel
# if your palette has a color in the general range of these
# segments of the color wheel, put it in here
#
# these are useful for having directories displayed in green
# no matter what shade of green is in the palette
#
# if your theme only has one blue color, make cyan, azure, and blue all be
# that color. If your theme has three purple colors, pick your best
# one for violet, and put the others as accent colors below
