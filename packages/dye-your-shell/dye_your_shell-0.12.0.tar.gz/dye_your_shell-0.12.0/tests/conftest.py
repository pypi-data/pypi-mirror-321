    '''a fixture that simulates runing dye from the command line

    this fixture returns a function, which allows us to call
    the fixture and pass parameters to it

    def test_unset_list(dye_cmdline, capsys):
        theme = """
        [styles]
        text = "#dddddd on #222222

        export.LS_COLORS = "ace ventura"
        """
        exit_code = dye_cmdline("apply -c", styles, pattern)
        ...

    This fixture allows us to pass a theme and a pattern in as strings,
    and also pass in any 'dye' command line we want. The fixture then
    patches the styles and pattern into 'dye' and runs the command line.

    Very convenient.
