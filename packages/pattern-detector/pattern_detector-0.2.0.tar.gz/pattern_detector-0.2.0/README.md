# Pattern Detector

`pattern_detector` is a Python library for detecting patterns in 1-D time-series data using advanced sliding window and similarity computations.

# Suggestion of use

Pattern selection is a crucial step for pattern detection algorithms. Try to select stationary start and end points in your signal for sample pattern.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pattern_detector
