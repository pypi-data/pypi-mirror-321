# `neon_api`: Python API wrapper for the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

`neon_api` is a Python wrapper designed to simplify interactions with the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). It provides a convenient way for developers to integrate their Python applications with the Neon platform, offering methods to manage API keys, projects, branches, databases, endpoints, roles, and operations programmatically.

With `neon_api`, you can automate tasks, streamline workflows, and build powerful integrations with ease.


## Installation

Installation of `neon_api` is easy, with pip:

```bash
$ pip install neon-api
```

## Usage

```python
from neon_api import NeonAPI

# Initialize the client.
neon = NeonAPI(api_key='your_api_key')
```

**[Documentation is available on ReadTheDocs](https://neon-api-python.readthedocs.io/)**.


Remember that you should never expose your api_key and handle it carefully since it gives access to sensitive data. It's better to set it as an environment variable (e.g. `NEON_API_KEY` + accompanying `neon_api.from_environ()`).

## Development

First, create a virtual environment, then install the dependencies of the library with `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies for development.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
# set up a .env file with your API key as per `.env.example`
$ make test
```

The tests don't require an internet connection, as they are mocked using the `pytest-vcr` library. To record new cassettes, use the following command:

```bash
$ make record
```

This will record new cassettes for the tests. Make sure to commit these cassettes along with your changes.

### Updating the schema

In order to update the Python data types from the OpenAPI schema, you need to:

```
$ mkdir neon_client/
$ make schema
# Now, take `neon_client/schema.py` and replace `neon_api/schema.py` with it.
# Now, run:
$ make test
# You may have to run `make record` to update the fixtures.
```
