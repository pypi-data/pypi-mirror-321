TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a method used to evaluate and rank alternatives by comparing them to an ideal solution. It calculates how close each option is to the best possible outcome and how far it is from the worst. By considering multiple criteria and their importance, TOPSIS helps make clear and logical decisions, often used in areas like project selection, resource allocation, and performance evaluation. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it a popular choice for solving complex problems.
