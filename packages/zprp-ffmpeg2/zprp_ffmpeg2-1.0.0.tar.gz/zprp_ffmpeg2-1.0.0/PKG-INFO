# ZPRP 24Z project repository
# Further development of zprp-ffmpeg library

## Design proposal

### Schedule
- [x] (27.10 - 03.11) Getting to know current functionalities of the zprp-ffmpeg library
- [ ] (03.11 - 17.11) Extending test coverage of existing functionalities to potentially uncover errors
- [x] (17.11 - 24.11) Fixing the string-based outputs processing from Node.get_command()
- [ ] (24.11 - 08.12) Working on multiple input sources support like in ffmpeg-python
- [x] (24.11 - 08.12) Working on support for merging multiple output streams, also like in ffmpeg-python
- [ ] (08.12 - 22.12) Working on covering the missing full compatibility with ffmpeg-python API
- [ ] (22.12 - 12.01) Writing tests to cover newly added functionalities
- [ ] (12.01 - 19.01) Updating documentation to fix shortcomings and cover new functions

### Planned changes to the existing library

- Further improvements to cover all the functionality of the ffmpeg-python API
- Add multi-input sources support (ffmpeg.input())
- Add multi-output merging support (ffmpeg.merge_outputs())
- Extend existing testing to cover more functionality of the ffmpeg-python library
- Achieve full compatibility with ffmpeg-python library tests
- In [filters source file](src/zprp_ffmpeg2/filter_graph.py) change the way outputs from get_command() are processed - refrain from returning strings
- Updating the documentation to include implemented changes
- Adding more detailed architecture description to explain the responsibilities of different components

### Technological stack remains the same as the one used in zprp-ffmpeg
- Python 3.8+
- pytest (tox)
- ffmpeg-python (for testing compatibility)
- mypy
- oslex (for code linting)
- poetry (for dependency management)
- tqdm (for progress bars)
- black
- tox
- networkx
- matplotlib
- pycparser
- tqdm
- ruff


### Testing methodology
- Unit tests for more functions for current functionalities, which are not covered yet
- Integration tests for newly added functionalities
- Tests for compatibility with ffmpeg-python library tests
  - This will be done by running the tests from the ffmpeg-python library on the zprp-ffmpeg library
- Tests for multi-input sources support
  - This will be done by presenting the examples with multiple input sources and checking if the command is generated correctly
- Tests for multi-output merging support
  - This will be done by presenting the examples with multiple output sources and checking if the command is generated correctly
