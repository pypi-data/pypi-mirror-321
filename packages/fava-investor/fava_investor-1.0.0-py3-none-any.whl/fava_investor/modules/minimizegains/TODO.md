### Summarize on top
- tax rates


### Improvements
- clarify, perhaps with text on top:
  - whether proceeds is gross or net
- ensure final amount is same as sum of assets (networth without liability)

## Features

### Graph
- cumulative tax liability against proceeds
- smooth line from 0 to full

### De-emphasize remaining columns
- marginal tax percent is repeated
- either with color or make them into bubble help
- remove unnecessary columns to simplify

### Optional "enter amount to liquidate"
- slider or some nice UI
- store in local storage


## Turn into total tax liability tool
- be able to specify tax rates for taxable vs tax advantages accounts
