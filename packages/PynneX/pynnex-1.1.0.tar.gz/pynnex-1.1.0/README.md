# PynneX

**Looking for a lightweight alternative to heavier event-driven, signal-slot, or concurrency libraries in Python?**  
PynneX is a pure-Python (asyncio-based) library that streamlines event-driven concurrency without forcing you to adopt large frameworks or external dependencies.

---

## Why PynneX?

Modern Python applications often combine async I/O and multithreading. Many existing event libraries or frameworks can bring in extra dependencies or complexities, especially if you only need clean, concurrency-focused event handling. PynneX offers a **focused** approach:

- **Decorator-based emitters and listeners** for writing succinct, event-driven code  
- **Built-in thread safety**—no need to manually handle locks or queues  
- **Easy background tasks** via `@nx_with_worker` decorator  
- **Asyncio integration**: either async or sync listeners work seamlessly  
- **No external dependencies** beyond Python 3.10+ (for improved asyncio support) 

**PynneX** can also serve as a **lightweight** alternative to more complex concurrency or distributed event frameworks, letting you scale from simple local threads up to multi-threaded or async scenarios without overhead.

---

## Key Features

- **Pure Python**: No external dependencies needed
- **Event Decorators**: `@nx_emitter` and `@nx_listener` for intuitive event-based design
- **Multiple Aliases Available**: Prefer different terminology?
  - Use `@nx_signal` and `@nx_slot` if you like Qt-style signal-slots
  - Use `@nx_publisher` and `@nx_subscriber` if you’re coming from a Pub/Sub background
  - All aliases share the same underlying mechanics
  - Use `@emitter`, `@listener`, `@signal`, `@slot`, `@publisher`, `@subscriber` interchangeably without prefix `nx_`
- **Thread-Safe**: Automatic cross-thread invocation ensures concurrency safety
- **asyncio-Friendly**: Support for both synchronous and asynchronous listeners
- **Background Workers**: `@nx_with_worker` provides a dedicated event loop in a separate thread
- **Weak Reference**: If you connect a listener with `weak=True`, the connection is removed automatically once the receiver is garbage-collected

### **Requires an Existing Event Loop**

PynneX depends on Python’s `asyncio`. You **must** have a running event loop (e.g., `asyncio.run(...)`) for certain features like async listeners or cross-thread calls.  
If no event loop is running, PynneX raises a `RuntimeError` instead of creating one behind the scenes—this ensures predictable concurrency behavior.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pynnex
```

PynneX requires **Python 3.10+**, leveraging newer asyncio improvements.
Alternatively, clone from GitHub and install locally: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nexconnectio/pynnex.git
cd pynnex
pip install -e .
```

For development (includes tests and linting tools):
```
pip install -e ".[dev]
```

## Quick Hello (Emitters/Listeners)

Here’s the simplest “Hello, Emitters/Listeners” example. Once installed, run the snippet below:

```python
# hello_pynnex.py
from pynnex import with_emitters, emitter, listener

@with_emitters
class Greeter:
    @emitter
    def greet(self):
        """Emitter emitted when greeting happens."""
        pass

    def say_hello(self):
        self.greet.emit("Hello from PynneX!")

@with_emitters
class Printer:
    @listener
    def on_greet(self, message):
        print(message)

greeter = Greeter()
printer = Printer()

# Connect the emitter to the listener
greeter.greet.connect(printer, printer.on_greet)

# Fire the emitter
greeter.say_hello()
```

**Output:**
```
Hello from PynneX!
```

By simply defining `emitter` and `listener`, you can set up intuitive event handling that also works smoothly in multithreaded contexts.

If you come from a Qt background or prefer “signal-slot” naming, use:

```python
from pynnex import with_signals, signal, slot

@with_signals
class Greeter:
    @signal
    def greet(self):
        """Signal that fires a greeting event."""
        pass

    def say_hello(self):
        self.greet.emit("Hello from PynneX!")

@with_signals
class Printer:
    @slot
    def on_greet(self, message):
        print(f"Received: {message}")
```

If you prefer a Pub/Sub style, use:

```python
from pynnex import with_signals, signal, slot

@with_publishers
class Greeter:
    @publisher
    def greet(self):
        """Publisher that fires a greeting event."""
        pass

    def say_hello(self):
        self.greet.emit("Hello from PynneX!")

@with_subscribers
class Printer:
    @subscriber
    def on_greet(self, message):
        print(f"Received: {message}")
```

They’re all interchangeable aliases pointing to the same core functionality.

## Usage & Examples

Below are some brief examples. For more, see the [docs/](https://github.com/nexconnectio/pynnex/blob/main/docs/) directory.

### Basic Counter & Display
```python
from pynnex import with_emitters, emitter, listener

@with_emitters
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
    
    @emitter
    def count_changed(self):
        pass
    
    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1
        self.count_changed.emit(self.count)

@with_emitters
class Display:
    @listener
    async def on_count_changed(self, value):
        print(f"Count is now: {value}")

# Connect and use
counter = Counter()
display = Display()
counter.count_changed.connect(display, display.on_count_changed)
counter.increment()  # Will print: "Count is now: 1"
```

### Asynchronous Listener Example
```python
@with_emitters
class AsyncDisplay:
    @listener
    async def on_count_changed(self, value):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate async operation
        print(f"Count updated to: {value}")

# Usage in async context
async def main():
    counter = Counter()
    display = AsyncDisplay()
    
    counter.count_changed.connect(display, display.on_count_changed)
    counter.increment()
    
    # Wait for async processing
    await asyncio.sleep(1.1)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Core Concepts

### Emitters and Listeners
- Emitters: Declared with `@nx_emitter`. Emitters are attributes of a class that can be emitted to notify interested parties.
- Listeners: Declared with `@nx_listener`. Listeners are methods that respond to emitters. Listeners can be synchronous or async functions.
- Connections: Use `emitter.connect(receiver, listener)` to link emitters to listeners. Connections can also be made directly to functions or lambdas.

### Thread Safety and Connection Types
PynneX automatically detects whether the emitter emission and listener execution occur in the same thread or different threads:

- **Auto Connection**: When connection_type is AUTO_CONNECTION (default), PynneX checks whether the listener is a coroutine function or whether the caller and callee share the same thread affinity. If they are the same thread and listener is synchronous, it uses direct connection. Otherwise, it uses queued connection.
- **Direct Connection**: If emitter and listener share the same thread affinity, the listener is invoked directly.
- **Queued Connection**: If they differ, the call is queued to the listener’s thread/event loop, ensuring thread safety.

This mechanism frees you from manually dispatching calls across threads.

### Thread-Safe Properties
The `@nx_property` decorator provides thread-safe property access with automatic emitter emission:

```python
@with_emitters
class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self._data = None
    
    @emitter
    def updated(self):
        """Emitter emitted when data changes."""
        pass
    
    @nx_property(notify=updated)
    def data(self):
        """Thread-safe property with change notification."""
        return self._data
    
    @data.setter
    def data(self, value):
        self._data = value

e = Example()
e.data = 42  # Thread-safe property set; emits 'updated' emitter on change
```

### Worker Threads
For background work, PynneX provides a `@nx_with_worker` decorator that:

- Spawns a dedicated event loop in a worker thread.
- Allows you to queue async tasks to this worker.
- Enables easy start/stop lifecycle management.
- Integrates with emitters and listeners for thread-safe updates to the main 

**Worker Example**
```python
from pynnex import nx_with_worker, emitter

@with_worker
class DataProcessor:
    @emitter
    def processing_done(self):
        """Emitted when processing completes"""

    async def run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # The main entry point for the worker thread’s event loop
        # Wait for tasks or stopping emitter
        await self.wait_for_stop()

    async def process_data(self, data):
        # Perform heavy computation in the worker thread
        result = await heavy_computation(data)
        self.processing_done.emit(result)

processor = DataProcessor()
processor.start()

# Queue a task to run in the worker thread:
processor.queue_task(processor.process_data(some_data))

# Stop the worker gracefully
processor.stop()
```
