24. Creating a Drop-down Menu with Joomla.
Step 1: CreaƟng a new menu By default, Joomla already has a Main Menu. If you don’t need
to create another menu set, you can skip to step 2, and start adding new menu items
directly to the main menu. To create a new menu, go to Menu > Manage > Add New Menu
Step 2: CreaƟng a new menu item
1. Go to Main Menu > Add New Menu item
The process is the same regardless of what style of menu you’re using. For each new menu
item, you’ll need to fill out the following fields in the Details tab - the other fields are
opƟonal.
Menu Title
Menu Item Type
Parent item
Status (Change to Published) Then press Save. For example, we set up the below menu
using “Single ArƟcle” as the menu item type.
Step 3: Displaying the menu on your site
This step is required when you create a new Joomla menu or need to display the same
menu in different places on your website.
To create a Menu Module. Go to: Extensions > Modules > Create New.
Once you’ve done this, you’ll have to set up your Menu Module.
Select menu: choose the menu you want to display.
PosiƟon: choose where you want to display it.
Now you can change the status to published and hit Save.
By default, Joomla displays your menu horizontally at the top of your webpage - this is
posiƟon 1 (ProtoStar template). We want to move this to display it in posiƟon 7, so that it
appears verƟcally on the right side of the screen.
Changing the posiƟon of your menu is easy. Simply select where you want it to be and let
Joomla do the rest.
