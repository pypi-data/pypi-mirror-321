# gsystemctl
Control the systemd service manager.

This is a graphical user interface for `systemctl` basic commands.
It uses the `systemctl` command directly, so any changes to it will affect how it works.

Dependencies:
- Python 3 - https://www.python.org/
- systemd (systemctl command) - http://systemd.io/
- PyGObject - https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/pygobject/

Keywords:
- systemd
- python
- Gtk 4

To install `gsystemctl` (something like this):
```bash
$ pip install gsystemctl-0.5.0.tar.gz
```
or simply to run (without installation):
```bash
$ gtk-systemctl.py
```
