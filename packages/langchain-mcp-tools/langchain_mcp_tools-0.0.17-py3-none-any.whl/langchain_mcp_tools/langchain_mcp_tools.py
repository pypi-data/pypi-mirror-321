Resource Management Pattern for Parallel Server Initialization
--------------------------------------------------------------
This code implements a specific pattern for managing async resources that
require context managers while enabling parallel initialization.
The key aspects are:

1. Core Challenge:

   A key requirement for parallel initialization is that each server must be
   initialized in its own dedicated task - there's no way around this as far as
   I know. However, this poses a challenge when combined with
   `asynccontextmanager`.

   - Resources management for `stdio_client` and `ClientSession` seems
     to require relying exclusively on `asynccontextmanager` for cleanup,
     with no manual cleanup options
     (based on the mcp python-sdk impl as of Jan 14, 2025)
   - Initializing multiple MCP servers in parallel requires a dedicated
     `asyncio.Task` per server
   - Need to keep sessions alive for later use by different tasks
     after initialization
   - Need to ensure proper cleanup later in the same task that created them

2. Solution Strategy:

   The key insight is to keep the initialization tasks alive throughout the
   session lifetime, rather than letting them complete after initialization.

   By using `asyncio.Event`s for coordination, we can:
   - Allow parallel initialization while maintaining proper context management
   - Keep each initialization task running until explicit cleanup is requested
   - Ensure cleanup occurs in the same task that created the resources
   - Provide a clean interface for the caller to manage the lifecycle

   Alternative Considered:
   A generator/coroutine approach using `finally` block for cleanup was
   considered but rejected because:
   - It turned out that the `finally` block in a generator/coroutine can be
     executed by a different task than the one that ran the main body of
     the code
   - This breaks the requirement that `AsyncExitStack.aclose()` must be
     called from the same task that created the context

3. Task Lifecycle:

   The following task lifecyle diagram illustrates how the above strategy
   was impelemented:
   ```
   [Task starts]
     ↓
   Initialize server & convert tools
     ↓
   Set ready_event (signals tools are ready)
     ↓
   await cleanup_event.wait() (keeps task alive)
     ↓
   When cleanup_event is set:
   exit_stack.aclose() (cleanup in original task)
   ```
This approach indeed enables parallel initialization while maintaining proper
async resource lifecycle management through context managers.
However, I'm afraid I'm twisting things around too much.
It usually means I'm doing something very worng...

I think it is a natural assumption that MCP SDK is designed with consideration
for parallel server initialization.
I'm not sure what I'm missing...
(FYI, with the TypeScript MCP SDK, parallel initialization was
pretty straightforward.
