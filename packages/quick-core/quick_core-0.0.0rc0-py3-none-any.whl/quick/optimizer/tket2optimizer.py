    """ `quick.optimizer.TKET2Optimizer` is the wrapper class for the optimizer provided by
    the `tket2` library. This optimizer utilizes the `tket2` rewrite rules to optimize the
    circuit.

    Notes
    -----
    The `tket2` library is a quantum circuit optimization library developed by Cambridge Quantum
    Computing. The library is written in Rust and provides a Python interface, providing a faster
    and more efficient optimization compared to the default optimizer provided by `tket`.

    The Badger compiler pass optimizes the circuit by applying multiple rewrite rules simultaneously
    and searching for the best sequence. Though computationally expensive, this process can significantly
    simplify large circuits.

    For more information, see https://github.com/CQCL/tket2.
