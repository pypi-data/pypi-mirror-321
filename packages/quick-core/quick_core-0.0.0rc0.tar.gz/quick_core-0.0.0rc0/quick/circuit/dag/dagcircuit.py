class DAGCircuit:
    """ A directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit.

    Notes
    -----
    Quantum circuits can be represented using DAGs, where each node represents
    a quantum operation and each edge represents a qubit that the operation acts
    on. This class is used to represent a quantum circuit as a DAG.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `num_qubits` : int
        The number of qubits in the circuit.

    Attributes
    ----------
    `num_qubits` : int
        The number of qubits in the circuit.
    `qubits` : dict[int, quick.circuit.dag.DAGNode]
        A dictionary mapping qubit indices to nodes in the DAG.

    Usage
    -----
    >>> circuit = DAGCircuit(2)

        Parameters
        ----------
        `operation` : dict
            A dictionary representing the operation to add to
            the circuit. This dictionary is the same as what
            is added to `quick.circuit.Circuit.circuit_log`.
