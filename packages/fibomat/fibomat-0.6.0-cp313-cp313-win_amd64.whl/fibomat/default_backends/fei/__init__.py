    """ Custom export to FEI Stream file type files. Allows to input variables that are convenient for Stream files. Exported file will have a filename 
    including horizontal field width (hfw) added to the file name.

    Keyword arguments:
        n_rep:          (int) The number of times to repeat whole pattern. More iterations does not increase file size.
        margin:         (float) How much of the imaging area is used for patterning. Range should be from 0.1 - 1.0.
        dac16bit:       (bool) The number of bits used in the digital to analog conversion by the instrument. 'True' will give 16 bit version,
        and 'False' will give 12 bit version. Instruments will use a 12 or 16 bit DAC. Check user manual for your instrument to know which one is appropriate.
        hfw_rounding:   (bool) Option for rounding the horizontal field width (hfw) to a value that ticks in place by instrument. Boolean value.
        time_low_res:   (bool) Choose if the time unit in Stream file is given in 'high' or 'low' resolution. 'high' corresponds to Stream file time unit of 25 ns,
        while 'low' corresponds to 100ns.
