# WhatsFly
[![Build](https://github.com/Labfox/whatsfly/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Labfox/whatsfly/actions/workflows/build.yml)
## Just run and have fun. Just try and go fly. 

> [!NOTE]  
> There currently isn't active development, but the project is still maintained. If you want a feature, please create an issue, I'll try to implement it as soon as possible (I usually respond withing 1-2 weeks).


WhatsApp web wrapper in Python. No selenium nor gecko web driver needed. 

Setting up browser driver is tricky for python newcomers, and thus it makes your code so 'laggy' while using lots of ram.
