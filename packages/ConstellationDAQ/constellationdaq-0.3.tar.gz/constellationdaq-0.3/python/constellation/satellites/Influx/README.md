description: "Satellite writing metrics to InfluxDB"
---

## Description

This satellite listens to metrics send by other satellites and writes to a InfluxDB time series database.
Only metrics of type float, integer and boolean can be written to InfluxDB.

```{warning}
Currently, the satellites subscribes to all metrics. This can lead to performance penalties if there are debugging metrics
which are evaluated in a hot loop. Excluding and including metrics is a feature that will be added in the future.
```
