QCManyBody is a python package for running quantum chemistry many-body expansions and interaction calculations in a
package-independent way.

## Installation

QCManyBody is available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qcmanybody) and from
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qcmanybody).

```bash
# Installation from PyPI
pip install qcmanybody

# Installation from conda-forge
conda install -c conda-forge qcmanybody
```

To install the latest development version directly from
[GitHub](https://github.com/MolSSI/QCManyBody), you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/MolSSI/QCManyBody.git
```
