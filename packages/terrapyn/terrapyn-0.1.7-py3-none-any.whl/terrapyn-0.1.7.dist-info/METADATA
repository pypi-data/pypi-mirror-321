Toolkit to manipulate Earth Observation Data: Remote Sensing, Climate and Weather models. Designed to work with `Pandas`/`GeoPandas` and `Xarray` data structures, implementing `Dask` where possible.

The name is pronounced the same as "terrapin", a type of [fresh water turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapin)

## Setup/Installation

### Python environment setup
An environment with Python version `3.10` or later is required. If you don't have this, it can be created using [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) which should be installed first. After installing Pyenv, download and install Python `3.10` using

```bash
pyenv install 3.10
```

If you already have Python version `3.10` or later you can skip this step.

### Install

#### Via Pip
The package can be installed in an existing Python environment via pip:

```bash
pip install terrapyn
```

#### From Source
Clone the repo and install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colinahill/terrapyn.git && cd terrapyn
```

This project uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) to manage dependencies, which should be installed first. Then, install the package with

```bash
pixi install
```
