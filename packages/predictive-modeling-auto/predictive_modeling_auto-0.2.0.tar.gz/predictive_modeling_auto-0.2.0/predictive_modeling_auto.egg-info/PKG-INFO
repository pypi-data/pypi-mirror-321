## Introduction
Predictive Modeling Auto is a Python project designed to streamline the process of building and evaluating predictive models. It leverages popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and PyCaret to automate various steps in the modeling pipeline.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Automated handling of missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
- **Model Training:** Automated model selection, training, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive user interface for ease of use.

## Usage
Here is a simple example of how to use this project:
```Python
from predictive_modeling_auto import ModelPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = ModelPipeline()

# Load your dataset
data = pipeline.load_data('path/to/your/dataset.csv')

# Preprocess the data
data = pipeline.preprocess_data(data)
