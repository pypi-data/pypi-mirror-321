# The yaml config consists of three sections, minerals, fluids and dryrock.
# Elastic values for dry rock, having the mineral as its pore-material and
# saturated with the fluid is outputed. The tutorial consists of three
# cases corresponding to the three rows in the data file.
#
# The tutorial can be executed as follows:
# petro_elastic --data-file tutorial_data.csv tutorial_config.yaml

# The minerals in this tutorial consists of sand and shale. The volume-fraction
# of sand is found in the data file. Since shale fraction is left out , it is
# assigned the remainder of volume.
minerals:
    constituents:
        - material: # sand
            bulk_modulus: 36.0E+9 #Pa
            shear_modulus: 44.0E+9 #Pa
            density: 2650.0 # kg/m3
            # fraction is found in csv file, column "sand_fraction"
          fraction:
            column: "sand_fraction"
        - material: # shale
            bulk_modulus: 11.0E+9 #Pa
            shear_modulus: 4.5E+9 #Pa
            density: 1.0 # kg/m3
            # fraction of shale is 1 - sum(other materials)

# As with minerals, fluids is mainly just the list of constituents,
# but temperature and pressure can be given which is used for the
# modeling of oil, brine, gas and condensate.
fluids:
    temperature: 75.0 # celsius

    constituents:
        - material:
            type: "oil"
            gas_gravity: 0.5 # ratio to air (air gas gravity is 1)
            reference_density: 800.0 # kg/m3
            gas_oil_ratio: 153.0 # ratio of gas to oil
          #fraction set to 1 - sum(other_fluid_fractions)
        - material:
            type: "brine"
            salinity: 45000 # ppm
          fraction: # Ratio of brine to remaining fluid
            column: "brine_saturation"
        - material:
            type: "condensate"
            gas_gravity: 0.5 # ratio to air (air gas gravity is 1)
            oil_reference_density: 800 # kg/m3
            gas_oil_ratio: 150.0 # ratio of gas to oil
          fraction: # Ratio of condensate to remianing fluids
             column: "condensate_saturation"

# The dry_rock section describes the porous dry rock of the dense mineral.
# The different models have several additional keys for tweaking the model.
# Additionally pressure dependency and depth trend adjustments can be added,
# see github.com/equinor/petro_elastic for more information.
dry_rock:
    model: "patchy_cement" # or "polyfit", "friable_sand"
    porosity:
        # porosity of dry rock gotten from the column in the data file with
        # name "porosity"
        column: "porosity"
    cement: # cement properties
      bulk_modulus: 36.8E+9 # Pa
