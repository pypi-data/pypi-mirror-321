# patchy cement is a hybrid model which is a combination of friable sand and
# contact cement. The properties of the hybrid model is on the line between
# two points, friable sand on one end and contact cement on the other end.
# The weights are calculated using a lower bound (friable sand with lower bound
# on pressure) and an upper bound (constant cement with upper bound porosity)
# Then the weight for e.g. bulk modulus is calculated as follows:
# w_bulk = (cc_bulk - lower_bulk) / (upper_bulk - lower_bulk)
# where cc_bulk is the bulk modulus of constant cement, upper_bulk is the bulk
# modulus of the upper bound, and lower_bulk is the bulk modulus of the lower bound.
