# real-llama-cpp-python
A simple custom wrapper for llama.cpp models in Python, support seamlessly interaction with LangChain. As the name suggests, it is truly a wrapper for llama.cpp, you should have installed llama.cpp into your machine prior to this.

## Background

While it might seem intuitive that llama-cpp-python would seamlessly integrate with llama.cpp, the reality is that installing llama-cpp-python is a pain in the bum. It is NOT simple as described `pip install llama-cpp-python`.  

Langchain, by default, supports [llama-cpp-python](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/llamacpp/). If you have a pipeline that works with Langchain, it would be very difficult to run the latest quantized model (gguf files downloaded from HuggingFace) from llama.cpp. The real-llama-cpp-python is a simplified and an alternative library designed to seamlessly integrate with LangChain while avoiding the pain of installing the library llama-cpp-python. 

llama.cpp can be installed or built easily. (If you are facing the challenge by the time you install llama.cpp, the llama.cpp community is also very active that any issue can be resolved in a few days (unlike llama-cpp-python).  

## Installation
As the name said, it is truly a wrapper for llama.cpp, you should first install llama.cpp into your machine. 

### 1 Install llama.cpp first

- **Highly recommend this method** Clone [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master) repository and build locally, see [how to build](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/build.md)
- On MacOS or Linux, install `llama.cpp` via [brew, flox or nix](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/install.md). Noted that, this brew install may not support GPU.
- Use a ``llama.cpp`` Docker image, see [documentation for Docker](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/docker.md). 
- **Have not tested yet** Download pre-built binaries from [releases](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases).

After successfully built/installed llama.cpp. You want to add llama.cpp directory to your `PATH` permanently by editing your shell configuration file:
```
vim ~/.bashrc 
```
or
```
source ~/.zshrc
```
Add the following line: 
```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/llama.cpp/build/bin
```

Save and run `source ~/.bashrc`  or `source ~/.zshrc`
You should be able to run `llama-cli` and `llama-server` from any directory. Verify the accessibility, run the following commands in any directory 

```
llama-cli --help
llama-server --help
```

### 2 Install llama.cpp
Now, you can install real-llama-cpp-python by either install the stable version through `pip install`
```bash
pip install real-llama-cpp-python
```
or clone the github repository for the developing features.

```
git clone https://github.com/minhtran1309/real-llama-cpp-python.git
cd real-llama-cpp-python
pip install -e .
```
