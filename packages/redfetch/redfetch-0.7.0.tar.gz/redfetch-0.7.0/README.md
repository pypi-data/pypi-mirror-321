redfetch is for updating EverQuest multiboxing software and scripts that RedGuides recommends, as well as those you "[watch](https://www.redguides.com/community/watched/resources)". It's also open source, how nice.

## Installation (Windows)

On Windows the easiest way to install redfetch is to [download](https://www.redguides.com/community/resources/redfetch.3177/download) and run [`redfetch.exe`](https://www.redguides.com/community/resources/redfetch.3177/download). (*optional: If you're still on Windows 10 and want a more modern appearance, follow [this guide](https://www.redguides.com/community/threads/redfetch.92998/post-634938) to set [Windows Terminal](https://www.redguides.com/community/threads/redfetch.92998/post-634938) as your default terminal.*)

### Alternate install for Linux or *cool* Windows users

Prerequisite: a recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

1) Install pipx
```bash
python -m pip install --user pipx
```

2) Make it so you can run packages without having to type python -m
```bash
python -m pipx ensurepath
```

3) Install redfetch
```bash
pipx install redfetch
```

When you open a new terminal window, you'll be able to run redfetch by typing `redfetch` from the command line.

## Usage


### 1) Double-click [`redfetch.exe`](https://www.redguides.com/community/resources/redfetch.3177/download) to run the script. 
Take a moment to consider your configuration and the settings tab.

### 2) Click the big blue "Easy Update" button. 
![a screenshot showing the easy update button](https://www.redguides.com/images/redfetchupdate.png)  
Wait until it completes. (It's updating *Very Vanilla MQ* and any of its scripts or plugins you have [watched on RedGuides](https://www.redguides.com/community/watched/resources), your licensed resources, and scripts recommended by staff. If you're watching thousands of resources, your first run will take a long time.)

### 3) In the shortcuts tab, click the "Very Vanilla MQ" button
![a screenshot showing the shortcuts tab](https://www.redguides.com/images/redfetchrunmq.png)

This starts MacroQuest, and now you're ready to multibox EQ.


## Add more MQ Scripts
To add more MacroQuest scripts, "watch" them on RedGuides, and then run the *Easy Update* button again.

![a screenshot showing the watch button on a resource page](https://www.redguides.com/images/watch.png)

If there are non-MQ resources you'd like to keep in sync with redfetch, you can add them as a "special resource" in the local settings file, as shown in settings section.

## Alternative Interfaces

### Command Line

To update everything you've watched from the command line (as well as special resources),

```bash
redfetch.exe --download-watched
```

### Web UI
Another UI option! Run this command and then browse https://www.redguides.com/community/resources
```bash
redfetch.exe --serve
```

![redfetch Web UI, with a hastily drawn circle around the install button](https://www.redguides.com/images/webui.png)

## Command-Line Options

- `--download-resource <RESOURCE_ID | URL>`: Downloads a resource by its ID or URL.
- `--download-watched`: Downloads all watched and special resources.
- `--force-download`: Clears recent download dates in the cache.
- `--list-resources`: Lists all resources in the cache.
- `--serve`: Runs as a flask server to interact with the web UI.
- `--update-setting <SETTING_PATH> <VALUE> [ENVIRONMENT]`: Updates a configuration setting. The setting path should be dot-separated. Environment is optional.
- `--switch-env <ENVIRONMENT>`: Changes the server type (`LIVE`, `TEST`, `EMU`).
- `--logout`: Logs out and clears cached tokens.
- `--uninstall`: Uninstalls redfetch and outputs a text guide for cleaning up downloaded data.
- `--version`: Displays the current version of redfetch.
- `push <resource_id> [options]`: Update you or your team's resource. [There's also a github action for this.](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/redguides-publish) Options include:
  - `--description <README.md>`: Path to a description file which will become the resource's overview description.
  - `--version <version_number>`: Specifies a new version number.
  - `--message <CHANGELOG.md | MESSAGE>`: Version update message or path to a changelog file.
  - `--file <FILE.zip>`: Path to the zipped release file.
  - `--domain <URL>`: Domain to prepend to relative URLs in README.md or CHANGELOG.md files. (mostly for images. e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepo/main/`)

## Settings

`settings.local.toml` is found in your configuration directory, which by default is `c:\Users\Public\redfetch\settings.local.toml`. Any keys you add will override their default values in [`settings.toml`](./src/redfetch/settings.toml).

All settings are prefixed with the environment,

- `[DEFAULT]` - encompasses all environments that are not explicitly defined.
- `[LIVE]` - EverQuest Live
- `[TEST]` - EverQuest Test
- `[EMU]` - EverQuest Emulator

### Adding a special resource
To add a "special resource" (a non-MQ resource that you want to keep updated), open `settings.local.toml` and add an entry. You'll need the [resource ID (numbers at the end of the url)](https://www.redguides.com/community/resources/brewalls-everquest-maps.153/) and a target directory. Example:

```toml
[LIVE.SPECIAL_RESOURCES.153]
custom_path = 'C:\Users\Public\Daybreak Game Company\Installed Games\EverQuest\maps\Brewall_Maps'
opt_in = true
```
* Note the use of single quotes around the path, which are required for windows paths.

The above will install Brewall's maps to the EQ maps directory the next time `--download-watched` is run for `LIVE` servers.

### Overwrite protection

If there are local files you don't want overwritten by a resource, you can add them to the `PROTECTED_FILES_BY_RESOURCE` setting. Include the resource ID and files you want to protect. e.g.,

```toml
[LIVE.PROTECTED_FILES_BY_RESOURCE]
1974 = ["CharSelect.cfg", "Zoned.cfg", "MQ2Map.ini", "MQ2MoveUtils.ini"]
153 = ["citymist.txt", "innothule.txt", "oasis.txt"]
```

## Tinkerers

If you self-compile MacroQuest or use a discord friend's copy, you can still keep your scripts and plugins in sync with redfetch by opting out of Very Vanilla:

```powershell
redfetch.exe --update-setting SPECIAL_RESOURCES.1974.opt_in false LIVE
redfetch.exe --update-setting SPECIAL_RESOURCES.60.opt_in false EMU
redfetch.exe --update-setting SPECIAL_RESOURCES.2218.opt_in false TEST
```
Alternately, you can add an entry to `settings.local.toml`:
```toml
[LIVE.SPECIAL_RESOURCES.1974]
opt_in = false
```
Then assign the *Very Vanilla MQ* path to your self-compiled MacroQuest.

## Todo
- Instead of keeping a db entry for each file downloaded and its version, we should check the files on the drive.
- Refactor download logic, now that we know our needs.
- Re-write auth for latest Xenforo version.
- Make "fetch" ui tab responsive at smaller sizes.
- Add custom buttons for "fetch" tab.
- Option: Close after update
- Launch programs with cli options
- Indicate when updated VV is available
- Launch more than just mq (eqbcs, etc) upon update. 

## Contributing

I'd love help, conceptually and technically. I'm not a developer and this is my first big python script. 

To set up a [development environment](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/environment/),

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RedGuides/redfetch
cd redfetch
pip install hatch
hatch env create dev
hatch shell dev
```
You can then run your dev version with,

`redfetch`

Or if the issue is ui-specific, run the [terminal UI in debug mode](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/devtools/#live-editing),

`textual run --dev .\src\redfetch\main.py`

When you're done, type `exit` to leave the shell.
