# Topsis-Nitin_Goyal-102203614

This Python library delivers a robust implementation of the TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) algorithm, designed for solving multi-criteria decision-making problems.

Key Features
Standardizes decision matrices for consistency.
Incorporates weights to reflect the relative importance of criteria.
Computes TOPSIS scores and ranks alternatives effectively.
Installation
You can install this package using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install Topsis-YourName-102203614
How to Use
Execute the TOPSIS method by providing:

A CSV file containing the decision matrix.
A set of weights for the criteria.
Positive (+) or negative (-) impacts for each criterion.
Example Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
python script.py input_data.csv "1,2,3" "+,-,+,-" output_result.csv
