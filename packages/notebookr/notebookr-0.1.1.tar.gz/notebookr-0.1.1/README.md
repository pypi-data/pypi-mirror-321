A simple tool to set up development environments for Jupyter notebooks. My motivation: basically, Jupyter notebooks are about the only program type for which it is *still* generally practiced to distribute the code through email or file sharing. 

I was tired of running the same setup process over and over with notebooks that are usually emailed to me. I work in IDEs, usually Cursor and sometimes VSCode, and naturally also work with git.

I complained to claude-3.5-sonnet about that, and here we are. 

Using notebookr you can typically cut that setup process down to a very short workflow:

1. Receive and save python notebook (.ipynb) file into a working directory
2. Open a terminal
3. `notebookr SomeNotebookYouGot.ipynb`
4. `code some-notebook-you-got`

Once your code editor opens, depening on your workflow, you ªll probably want to open the terminal (ctrl-`) and enter either

5. `source .venv/bin/activate` 
... or:
6. `.venv\Scripts\activate` # windows

# Installation

```bash
pip install notebookr
```
# or
```bash
uv add notebookr
```

# Usage

```bash
notebookr path/to/your/notebook.ipynb
```

```bash
notebookr --with_py path/to/your/notebook.ipynb # Also creates a python copy of the notebook
```

This will:
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Generate requirements.txt based on imports in your notebook
3. Create a .gitignore
4. Initialize a git repository
5. Install required packages
