Simple, fast integration with object storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and S3-compliant APIs like Cloudflare R2.

- Sync and async API.
- Streaming downloads with configurable chunking.
- Streaming uploads from async or sync iterators.
- Streaming `list`, with no need to paginate.
- File-like object API and [fsspec](https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec) integration.
- Support for conditional put ("put if not exists"), as well as custom tags and attributes.
- Automatically uses [multipart uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html) under the hood for large file objects.
- Optionally return list results as [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), which is faster than materializing Python `dict`/`list` objects.
- Easy to install with no required Python dependencies.
- The [underlying Rust library](https://docs.rs/object_store) is production quality and used in large scale production systems, such as the Rust package registry [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
- Zero-copy data exchange between Rust and Python in `get_range`, `get_ranges`, `GetResult.bytes`, and `put` via the Python [buffer protocol](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/05/05/introduction-to-the-python-buffer-protocol/).
- Simple API with static type checking.
- Helpers for constructing from environment variables and `boto3.Session` objects
