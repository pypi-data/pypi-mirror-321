# Motivation

Current data quality frameworks often fall short in providing detailed explanations for specific row or column 
data quality issues and are primarily designed for complete datasets, 
making integration into streaming workloads difficult.

This project introduces a simple Python validation framework for assessing data quality of PySpark DataFrames. 
It enables real-time quality validation during data processing rather than relying solely on post-factum monitoring.
The validation output includes detailed information on why specific rows and columns have issues, 
allowing for quicker identification and resolution of data quality problems.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databrickslabs/dqx/refs/heads/main/docs/dqx.png" alt="dqx checks">

Invalid data can be quarantined to make sure bad data is never written to the output.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databrickslabs/dqx/refs/heads/main/docs/dqx_quarantine.png" alt="quarantine">

In the Lakehouse architecture, the validation of new data should happen at the time of data entry into the Curated Layer 
to make sure bad data is not propagated to the subsequent layers. With DQX you can easily quarantine invalid data and re-ingest it 
after curation to ensure that data quality constraints are met.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databrickslabs/dqx/refs/heads/main/docs/dqx_lakehouse.png" alt="lakehouse">

For monitoring the data quality of already persisted data in a Delta table (post-factum monitoring), we recommend to use 
[Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring](https://docs.databricks.com/en/lakehouse-monitoring/index.html).

# Key Capabilities

- Info of why a check has failed.
- Data format agnostic (works on Spark DataFrames).
- Support for Spark Batch and Streaming including DLT (Delta Live Tables).
- Different reactions on failed checks, e.g. drop, mark, or quarantine invalid data.
- Support for check levels: warning (mark) or errors (mark and don't propagate the rows).
- Support for quality rules at row and column level.
- Profiling and generation of data quality rules candidates.
- Checks definition as code or config.
- Validation summary and data quality dashboard for identifying and tracking data quality issues.

# Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later. See [instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Unity Catalog-enabled [Databricks workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/index.html).
- Network access to your Databricks Workspace used for the [installation process](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/tree/main/#installation).
- (Optional) Databricks CLI v0.213 or later. See [instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html).
- Databricks Runtime with Spark 3.5.0 or higher. See [instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/create.html).

# Installation

The project can be installed on a Databricks workspace or used as a standalone library.

## Installation as Library

Install the project via `pip`:

```commandline
pip install databricks-labs-dqx
```

## Installation in a Databricks Workspace

### Authentication

Once you install Databricks CLI, authenticate your current machine to your Databricks Workspace:

```commandline
databricks auth login --host <WORKSPACE_HOST>
```

To enable debug logs, simply add `--debug` flag to any command.
More about authentication options [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/authentication.html).

### Install DQX in the Databricks workspace

Install DQX in your Databricks workspace via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs install dqx
```

You'll be prompted to select a [configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth.html#databricks-client-unified-authentication) created by `databricks auth login` command,
and other configuration options.

The cli command will install the following components in the workspace:
- A Python [wheel file](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/) with the library packaged.
- DQX configuration file ('config.yml').
- Profiling workflow for generating quality rule candidates.
- Quality dashboard for monitoring to display information about the data quality issues.

DQX configuration file can contain multiple run configurations defining specific set of input, output and quarantine locations etc.
During the installation the "default" run configuration is created.
You can add additional run configurations after the installation by editing the 'config.yml' file in the installation directory on the Databricks workspace:
```yaml
log_level: INFO
run_config:
- name: default
  checks_file: checks.yml
  curated_location: main.dqx.curated
  input_location: main.dqx.input
  output_location: main.dqx.output
  profile_summary_stats_file: profile_summary_stats.yml
  quarantine_location: main.dqx.quarantine
- name: another_run_config
  ...
```

To select a specific run config when executing the dqx labs cli commands use `--run-config` parameter. 
When not provided the "default" run config is used.

By default, DQX is installed in the user home directory (under `/Users/<user>/.dqx`). You can also install DQX globally
by setting 'DQX_FORCE_INSTALL' environment variable. The following options are available:
* `DQX_FORCE_INSTALL=global databricks labs install dqx`: will force the installation to be for root only (`/Applications/dqx`)
  * `DQX_FORCE_INSTALL=user databricks labs install dqx`: will force the installation to be for user only (`/Users/<user>/.dqx`)

To list all installed dqx workflows in the workspace and their latest run state, execute the following command:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx workflows
```

### Install the tool on the Databricks cluster

After you install the tool on the workspace, you need to install the DQX package on a Databricks cluster.
You can install the DQX library either from PYPI or use a wheel file generated as part of the installation in the workspace.

There are multiple ways to install libraries in a Databricks cluster (see [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/libraries/index.html)).
For example, you can install DQX directly from a notebook cell as follows:
```python
# using PYPI package:
%pip install databricks-labs-dqx

# using wheel file, DQX installed for the current user:
%pip install /Workspace/Users/<user-name>/.dqx/wheels/databricks_labs_dqx-*.whl

# using wheel file, DQX installed globally:
%pip install /Applications/dqx/wheels/databricks_labs_dqx-*.whl
```

Restart the kernel after the package is installed in the notebook:
```python
# in a separate cell run:
dbutils.library.restartPython()
```

### Upgrade DQX in the Databricks workspace

Verify that DQX is installed:

```commandline
databricks labs installed
```

Upgrade DQX via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs upgrade dqx
```

### Uninstall DQX from the Databricks workspace

Uninstall DQX via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs uninstall dqx
```

Databricks CLI will confirm a few options:
- Whether you want to remove all dqx artefacts from the workspace as well. Defaults to 'no'.

# How to use it

## Demos

After the installation of the tool in the workspace, 
you can upload the following notebooks in the Databricks workspace to try it out:
* [DQX Demo Notebook (library)](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/tree/main/demos/dqx_demo_library.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX as a library.
* [DQX Demo Notebook (tool)](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/tree/main/demos/dqx_demo_tool.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX as a tool.
* [DQX DLT Demo Notebook](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/tree/main/demos/dqx_dlt_demo.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX with Delta Live Tables (DLT).

## Data Profiling and Quality Rules Generation

Data profiling is run to profile the input data and generate quality rule candidates with summary statistics.
The generated rules/checks are input for the quality checking (see [Adding quality checks to the application](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/tree/main/#adding-quality-checks-to-the-application)).
In addition, the DLT generator can be used to generated native Delta Live Tables (DLT) expectations.

### In Python

Profiling and generating DQX rules/checks:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.profiler import DQProfiler
from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.generator import DQGenerator
from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.dlt_generator import DQDltGenerator
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

ws = WorkspaceClient()
profiler = DQProfiler(ws)
summary_stats, profiles = profiler.profile(df)

# generate DQX quality rules/checks
generator = DQGenerator(ws)
checks = generator.generate_dq_rules(profiles)  # with default level "error"

# generate DLT expectations
dlt_generator = DQDltGenerator(ws)
dlt_expectations = dlt_generator.generate_dlt_rules(profiles)
```

### Using CLI 

You must install DQX in the workspace before (see [installation](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/tree/main/#installation-in-a-databricks-workspace)).
As part of the installation, profiler workflow is installed. It can be run manually in the workspace UI or using the CLI as below.

Run profiler workflow:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx profile --run-config "default"
```

You will find the generated quality rule candidates and summary statistics in the installation folder as defined in the run config.
If run config is not provided, the "default" run config will be used. The run config is used to select specific run configuration from the 'config.yml'.

The following DQX configuration from 'config.yml' are used:
- 'input_location': input data as a path or a table.
- 'input_format': input data format. Required if input data is a path.
- 'checks_file': relative location of the generated quality rule candidates (default: `checks.yml`).
- 'profile_summary_stats_file': relative location of the summary statistics (default: `profile_summary.yml`).

Logs are be printed in the console and saved in the installation folder.
To show the saved logs from the latest profiler workflow run, visit the Databricks workspace UI or execute the following command:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx logs --workflow profiler
```

## Validating quality rules (checks)

If you manually adjust the generated rules or create your own configuration, you can validate them before using:

### In Python

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine

status = DQEngine.validate_checks(checks)
print(status)
```

The checks validated automatically when applied as part of the 
`apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split` and `apply_checks_by_metadata` methods 
(see [Quality rules defined as config](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/tree/main/#quality-rules-defined-as-config)).

### Using CLI

Validate checks stored in the installation folder:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx validate-checks --run-config "default"
```

The following DQX configuration from 'config.yml' will be used by default:
- 'checks_file': relative location of the quality rule (default: `checks.yml`).

## Adding quality checks to the application

### Quality rules defined as config

Quality rules can be stored in `yaml` or `json` file. Below an example `yaml` file defining checks ('checks.yml'):
```yaml
- criticality: error
  check:
    function: is_not_null
    arguments:
      col_names:
      - col1
      - col2
- name: col_col3_is_null_or_empty
  criticality: error
  check:
    function: is_not_null_and_not_empty
    arguments:
      col_name: col3
- criticality: warn
  check:
    function: value_is_in_list
    arguments:
      col_name: col4
      allowed:
      - 1
      - 2
```
Fields:
- `criticality`: either "error" (data going only into "bad/quarantine" dataframe) or "warn" (data going into both dataframes).
- `check`: column expression containing "function" (check function to apply), "arguments" (check function arguments), and "col_name" (column name as str to apply to check for) or "col_names" (column names as array to apply the check for). 
- (optional) `name` for the check: autogenerated if not provided.

#### Loading and execution methods

**Method 1: load checks from a workspace file in the installation folder**

If the tool is installed in the workspace, the config contains path to the checks file:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

# use check file specified in the default run configuration in the global installation config ('config.yml')
# can optionally specify the run config and whether to use user installation
checks = dq_engine.load_checks_from_installation(assume_user=True)

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

Check are validated automatically as part of the `apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split` and `apply_checks_by_metadata` methods.

**Method 2: load checks from a workspace file**

The checks can also be loaded from any file in the Databricks workspace:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())
checks = dq_engine.load_checks_from_workspace_file("/Shared/App1/checks.yml")

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

**Method 3: load checks from a local file**

The checks can also be loaded from a file in the local file system:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

checks = DQEngine.load_checks_from_local_file("checks.yml")
dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

### Quality rules defined as code

**Method 1: using DQX classes**

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.col_functions import is_not_null, is_not_null_and_not_empty, value_is_in_list
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine, DQRuleColSet, DQRule
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

checks = DQRuleColSet( # define rule for multiple columns at once
            columns=["col1", "col2"], 
            criticality="error", 
            check_func=is_not_null).get_rules() + [
         DQRule( # define rule for a single column
            name='col3_is_null_or_empty',
            criticality='error', 
            check=is_not_null_and_not_empty('col3')),
         DQRule( # name auto-generated if not provided       
            criticality='warn', 
            check=value_is_in_list('col4', ['1', '2']))
        ]

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks(input_df, checks)
```

See details of the check functions [here](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/tree/main/#quality-rules--functions).

**Method 2: using yaml config**

```python
import yaml
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

checks = yaml.safe_load("""
- criticality: "error"
  check:
    function: "is_not_null"
    arguments:
      col_names:
        - "col1"
        - "col2"

- criticality: "error"
  check:
    function: "is_not_null_and_not_empty"
    arguments:
      col_name: "col3"

- criticality: "warn"
  check:
    function: "value_is_in_list"
    arguments:
      col_name: "col4"
      allowed:
        - 1
        - 2
""")

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

See details of the check functions [here](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/tree/main/#quality-rules--functions).

### Integration with DLT (Delta Live Tables)

DLT provides [expectations](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/expectations.html) to enforce data quality constraints. However, expectations don't offer detailed insights into why certain checks fail.
The example below demonstrates how to integrate DQX checks with DLT to provide comprehensive information on why quality checks failed.
The integration does not use expectations but the DQX checks directly.

**Option 1: apply quality rules and quarantine bad records**

```python
import dlt
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

checks = ... # quality rules / checks

@dlt.view
def bronze_dq_check():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze")
  return dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(df, checks)

@dlt.table
def silver():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
  # get rows without errors or warnings, and drop auxiliary columns
  return dq_engine.get_valid(df)

@dlt.table
def quarantine():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
  # get only rows with errors or warnings
  return dq_engine.get_invalid(df)
```

**Option 2: apply quality rules as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)**

```python
import dlt
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

checks = ... # quality rules / checks
dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

@dlt.view
def bronze_dq_check():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze")
  return dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(df, checks)

@dlt.table
def silver():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
  return df
```

You can check implementation details of the rules [here](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/tree/main/src/databricks/labs/dqx/col_functions.py).

## Creating your own checks

### Use sql expression

If a check that you need does not exist in DQX, you can define them using sql expression rule (`sql_expression`),
for example:
```yaml
- criticality: "error"
  check:
    function: "sql_expression"
    arguments:
      expression: "col1 LIKE '%foo'"
      msg: "col1 ends with 'foo'"
```

Sql expression is also useful if you want to make cross-column validation, for example:
```yaml
- criticality: "error"
  check:
    function: "sql_expression"
    arguments:
      expression: "a > b"
      msg: "a is greater than b"
```

### Define custom check functions

If you need a reusable check or need to implement a more complicated logic
you can define your own check functions. A check is a function available from 'globals' that returns `pyspark.sql.Column`, for example:

```python
import pyspark.sql.functions as F
from pyspark.sql import Column
from databricks.labs.dqx.col_functions import make_condition

def ends_with_foo(col_name: str) -> Column:
    column = F.col(col_name)
    return make_condition(column.endswith("foo"), f"Column {col_name} ends with foo", f"{col_name}_ends_with_foo")
```

Then you can use the function as a check:
```python
import yaml
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
from databricks.labs.dqx.col_functions import *

checks = yaml.safe_load("""
- criticality: "error"
  check:
    function: "ends_with_foo"
    arguments:
      col_name: "col1"
""")

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks, globals())

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks, globals())
```

You can see all existing DQX checks [here](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/tree/main/src/databricks/labs/dqx/col_functions.py). 

Feel free to submit a PR to DQX with your own check so that other can benefit from it (see [contribution guide](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/tree/main/#contribution)).
