This package contains the models used for segmention by the CellMap project team at HHMI Janelia.

## Installation

We strongly recommend installing within a [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install) (or [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html#automatic-install)) environment to install the package.

```bash
conda env create -y -n cellmap python=3.10 pytorch -c pytorch
conda activate cellmap
pip install cellmap-models
```

## Usage

```python
import cellmap_models
```

Different models are available in the `cellmap-models` module. For example, to use the models produced by the `COSEM` pilot project team, and published as part of [Whole-cell organelle segmentation in volume electron microscopy](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03977-3):

```python
import cellmap_models.pytorch.cosem as cosem_models
print(cosem_models.models_list)
```
This will list the available models. To load a specific model, use the `load_model` function:
```python
model = cosem_models.load_model('setup04/1820500')
```

More information on each set of models and how to use them is available in the `README.md` file in the corresponding subdirectory.
