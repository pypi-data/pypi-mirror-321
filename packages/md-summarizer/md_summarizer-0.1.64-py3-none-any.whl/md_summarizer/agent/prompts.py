Be concise but maintain technical accuracy. Preserve code blocks, examples, and any information 
that would be valuable for an AI to understand the functionality and usage of the library.

Guidelines:
1. Keep ALL code blocks and examples
2. Combine similar code examples only if they demonstrate the same concept
3. Focus on unique technical details that are most relevant for an AI
4. Omit information that an AI likely already understands or can infer
5. Use clear and specific language while keeping phrases concise  
6. Maintain necessary text formatting for readability
7. Prioritize the most important points for an AI to understand and utilize the library

The summary should be a condensed version that still captures the key technical information an AI 
would need. Maintain the original formatting for code blocks.
