Subject: [PATCH] gsocket windows: check event before calling
 WSAEnumNetworkEvents

The WSAEnumNetworkEvents API is called every time the socket
needs to be checked for status changes. Doing this in an application
with several sockets could generate a high cpu usage since
this call is done for each socket at each iteration of the main loop.
Since there is also a WSAEvent that gets signaled when there is
a change in the status of the socket, checking its status and
calling the WSAEnumNetworkEvents API only if the event is signaled,
can reduce the overall cpu usage.
