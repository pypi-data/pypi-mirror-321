# pvtlib

`pvtlib` is a Python library that provides various tools in the categories of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and metering. The library includes functions for calculating flow rates, energy balances, and other related calculations.

## Installation

You can install the library using `pip`:

```sh
pip install pvtlib
```

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the library:

```py
from pvtlib.metering import differential_pressure_flowmeters

# Example usage of the calculate_flow_venturi function
result = differential_pressure_flowmeters.calculate_flow_venturi(D=0.1, d=0.05, dP=200, rho1=1000)
print(result)
```
