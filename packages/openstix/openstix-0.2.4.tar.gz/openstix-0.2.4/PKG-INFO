# OpenSTIX

OpenSTIX is an **unofficial STIX 2.1 library and toolkit** built upon the foundations of the [STIX2 library](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-python-stix2/), aimed at enhancing the efficiency and productivity of cybersecurity professionals. It's developed and maintained by AbuseTotal, a startup committed to delivering high-quality software solutions in the cybersecurity domain.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Organizes the functionalities provided by STIX2 library into modules for easy consumption and extension.
- **Workspace Class**: Extends the `Environment` class into a `Workspace` class to facilitate seamless creation, removal, and management of STIX SDOs (Structured Data Objects) based on contributing properties.
- **Built-in Datasets**: Provides ready-to-use datasets including MITRE frameworks, geolocations, custom TLP markings, and industries to expedite the analytical process.
- **Custom Objects and Extensions**: Offers custom objects and extensions to assist analysts with additional informational resources such as Whois and DNS-Records.
