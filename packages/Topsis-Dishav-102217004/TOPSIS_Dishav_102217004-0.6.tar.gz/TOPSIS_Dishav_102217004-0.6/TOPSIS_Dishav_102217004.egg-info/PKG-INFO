ï»¿# **TOPSIS - Dishav_Singla-102217004**

A Python implementation of the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method, designed for decision-making in multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).

---

## **Project Description**

This project implements the **TOPSIS** technique, a popular method used in decision-making that evaluates multiple alternatives based on various criteria. The project is focused on applying **TOPSIS** to a given dataset with multiple alternatives and criteria. The objective is to rank and identify the best alternative by calculating the **relative closeness** of each alternative to the ideal solution.

### **Objective**

- To apply **TOPSIS** on a sample dataset.
- To rank different alternatives based on defined criteria.
- To generate a ranking list of the alternatives for decision-making purposes.

---

## **Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and normalized.
- **TOPSIS Algorithm**: Implementation of the **TOPSIS** method, including the calculation of:
  - Ideal and negative-ideal solutions.
  - Separation measures.
  - Relative closeness to the ideal solution.
- **Ranking**: Rank the alternatives based on the relative closeness.
- **Visualizations**: Plot results (optional, if applicable).
