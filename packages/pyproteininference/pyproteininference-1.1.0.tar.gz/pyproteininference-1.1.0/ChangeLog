0.9.3
-----

* Updated README by fixing typos, split the file into a quick start and advanced section, added a quick start section so users can jump right in quickly, and updated the help text in the scripts to read better
* Added slim parameter file for new test
* Updated parameters so that parameter files can be incomplete. Parameters not defined in the yaml get set to default options. Also updated to version 0.9.3
* Changed GenericReader to use DictReader and fixed its ability to actually get the alternative proteins from percolator input files (This was broken). Updated test data which was formatted incorrectly with tabs purposefully put in in the header. This made it seem like the old reader was getting alternative proteins but real percolator files are not formatted with these empty tabs in the header. Also added a test to ensure that reading alternative proteins from input works properly
* Added method to recover proteins that dont exist in the database digestions but that do exist in the psm data. Certain edge cases such as using the improper database as input can create issues here. This method circumvents these issues

* Minor change to figure legend of the heuristic plot
