Description: # CS410 Arena
        
        A Go game arena for running bot competitions in CS410.
        
        ## Running the Arena
        
        Given that the submission files are in the `submissions` director (presumably from the autograder script),  
        here's what you need to do to run the arena:  
        Note: Some of this is still in development, so the instructions may change as I refine this in the future.  
        
        1. CD into submissions/shared and build the base Dockerfile as cs410base by running:  
        
            ```bash
            docker build -f BaseDockerfile -t cs410base .
            ```
        
        2. Update the corresponding config in go_config to match what settings you want to run.
        
        3. CD back out to the root of the directory and run the following command:  
        
            ```bash
            docker network create tournament
            docker compose --env-file configs/go_config.env up
            ```
        
        4. The arena should now be running. You can observe the logs in logs and the results in meta after it's done. This will take up a lot of image space depending on the number of submissions so make sure to clean up docker images after you're done.
