# Security Policy

## Environment Variable Management

Ensure sensitive information in environment variables is not exposed. Use a `.env` file for local development and avoid committing it to the repository. For example, the `.env` files in `src/backend/.env.example` and `src/backend/agentic-fleet/frontend/.env.example` should be properly managed. 🔒

## Dependency Management

Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like Dependabot, which is already configured in `.github/dependabot.yml`. 🛠️

## Access Control

Implement strict access control policies. Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the repository and sensitive information. 🔐

## Code Review

Enforce code reviews for all pull requests to ensure that no malicious code is introduced. 🧐

## Security Headers

Add security headers to the FastAPI application in `src/backend/app.py` to protect against common web vulnerabilities. 🛡️

## Telemetry

Review and manage telemetry settings in `src/.chainlit/config.toml` and `src/backend/.chainlit/config.toml` to ensure no sensitive data is being collected or transmitted. 📊

## Session Management

Ensure secure session management practices, such as setting appropriate session timeouts and using secure cookies, as seen in `src/.chainlit/config.toml` and `src/backend/.chainlit/config.toml`. ⏳

## Input Validation

Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks. This is particularly important for user inputs handled in `src/backend/app.py`. 🛡️

## Logging

Ensure that logs do not contain sensitive information and are securely stored. The logging configuration in `src/backend/models/logging.py` should be reviewed and updated as necessary. 📜
