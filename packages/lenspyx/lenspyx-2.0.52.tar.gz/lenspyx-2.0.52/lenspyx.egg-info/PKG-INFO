# lenspyx

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/Lenspyx.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/Lenspyx)[![alt text](https://readthedocs.org/projects/lenspyx/badge/?version=latest)](https://lenspyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest)![Build Status](https://github.com/carronj/lenspyx/actions/workflows/pytest.yaml/badge.svg)

Curved-sky python lensed CMB maps simulation package by Julien Carron.

This allows one to build very easily lensed CMB simulations. 

The package explicitly provides a few methods for most basic usage (such alm2lenmap and synfast). Check the [doc](https://lenspyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest) (which refers to the repo master branch). 
There is also a notebook [demo_lenspyx](examples/demo_lenspyx.ipynb) for examples and sanity checks.

There are further tools for CMB lensing reconstruction (adjoint lensing etc.) which may be useful to CMB-lensing intensive applications.

**From v2 onwards (april 2023)**: 

Lenspyx now essentially only wraps extremely efficient routines from [DUCC](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/mtr/ducc) by M.Reinecke,
with massive speed-ups and accuracy improvements (see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10431)), in a way incompatible to v1 which is now abandoned.

Required is ducc0 version >= 0.30.0.
For best performance, please refer to the [DUCC page](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/mtr/ducc) for installation instructions making profit of compiler-specfic optimizations.

### Installation

The code should hopefully be platform independent.

Editable installation from source: clone the repo and
    
    pip install --no-binary ducc0 -e ./ [--user]

From pypi

    pip install --no-binary ducc0 lenspyx [--user]

The –-user is required only if you don’t have write permission to your main python installation.
The ducc0 installation without binaries might take a while (several minutes).

In case you use this package and also wish to acknowledge it, you can provide a reference to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10431).
