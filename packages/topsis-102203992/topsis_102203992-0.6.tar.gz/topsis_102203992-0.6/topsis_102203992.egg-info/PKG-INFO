TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a decision-making method used to rank options based on their closeness to the best possible choice. It works by comparing each option to an ideal solution, which has the best values for all criteria, and an anti-ideal solution, which has the worst values. The method calculates scores based on how close each option is to the ideal and how far it is from the worst. Simple and efficient, TOPSIS is often used in business, engineering, and management to make decisions when multiple factors need to be considered.
