"""**Adapters** are used to adapt Aibaba AI models to other APIs.

Aibaba AI integrates with many model providers.
While Aibaba AI has its own message and model APIs,
Aibaba AI has also made it as easy as
possible to explore other models by exposing an **adapter** to adapt Aibaba AI
models to the other APIs, as to the OpenAI API.
