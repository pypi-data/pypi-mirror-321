# **Topsis Package**

This Python package implements the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method for multi-criteria decision-making problems. It helps in ranking and selecting from a set of alternatives based on weights and impacts of the given criteria.

## **What is TOPSIS?**
TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. It ranks alternatives based on their similarity to the ideal solution (highest value) and their distance from the negative ideal solution (lowest value). The method is widely used for decision analysis across various domains.

## **Features**
- Computes TOPSIS scores and rankings for alternatives.
- Accepts custom weights and impacts for criteria.
- Supports command-line execution and integration into Python programs.
- Outputs results as a CSV file with scores and ranks.
