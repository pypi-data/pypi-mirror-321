/**
 * An administrative division, or more commonly called an "area", is a
 * demarcated geographic area of the Earth, such as a portion of a
 * country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration.
 *
 * Countries are divided up into these smaller units.  For example, a
 * country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided
 * into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part
 * into municipalities; and so on.
 *
 * @todo: ISO 3166-2 is part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the
 *     International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and
 *     defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g.,
 *     provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1.  The
 *     official name of the standard is Codes for the representation of
 *     names of countries and their subdivisions â€“ Part 2: Country
