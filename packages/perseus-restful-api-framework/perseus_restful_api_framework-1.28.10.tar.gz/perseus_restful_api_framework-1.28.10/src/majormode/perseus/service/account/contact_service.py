        Enable a contact information that a user has confirmed through a
        challenge/response verification process


        There are two methods to complete a contact verification process:

        1. Either to provide the identification of the contact verification
           request `request_id`

        2. Either to provide the activation code that was generated with the
           contact verification request, and to provide the contact that was
           requested to be verified (the activation code might not be unique
           among all the contacts that are requested to be verified).

        If the user doesn't have any account, the function will automatically
        create an account for him and associate this contact information to
        his account.

        The function silently deletes any other verification requests that
        would have been initiated by other users for this same contact
        information.  The function also automatically soft-deletes any user
        account that would be only linked to this contact information.

        If the user doesn't have any primary contact information defined of
        this type, the function will automatically set this contact
        information as the primary.


        @warning: this function MUST NOT be directly surfaced to any client
            application, but SHOULD be used by the server controller of a
            client application.


        @param app_id: identification of the client application such as a Web,
            a desktop, or a mobile application, that accesses the service.

        @param connection: An object `RdbmsConnection` with auto commit.

        @param contact: The contact information that the user is verifying.
            The argument `verification_code` MUST be also passed to this
            function.

        @param request_id: identification of the verification request that has
            been sent to the user.

        @param verification_code: A pseudo-random number (nonce) that was
            generated and sent to the user to verify his contact information.
            The argument `contact` MUST be also passed to this function.


        @return: The function returns an instance `contact` or a tuple of
            instances `contact, session` depending on whether the parameter
            `auto_sign_in` has been set to, respectively `False`, or

                  preferred language that this user has selected when he has added
                  this contact information to his account, or, if not defined at this
                  time, when he has confirmed this contact information or, if still
                  not defined at this time, the default locale.

                * `value`: value of this contact information.

                * `creation_time` (optional): time when this account has been
                  registered.  This information should be stored by the client
                  application to manage its cache of accounts.

                * `expiration_time` (optional): time when the login session will
                  expire.  This information is provided if the client application
                  requires the platform to automatically sign-in the user (cf.
