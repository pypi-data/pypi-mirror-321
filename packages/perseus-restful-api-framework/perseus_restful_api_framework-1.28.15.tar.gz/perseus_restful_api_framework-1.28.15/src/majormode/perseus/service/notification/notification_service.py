    A notification is a lightweight message that needs to be delivered to
    one or more recipients.  It informs the recipients about an event
    that occurs, which might require fetching additional data from the
    server platform or requesting the recipient to perform some action.

    A recipient is generally a client application that acts on behalf of a
    user, but it could also be an agent or botnet that controls a device.

    A message can be delivered to a recipient using different styles of
    network communication:

    - ``email``: the message is delivered in an Internet electronic mail
      message to the specified recipients based on a store-and-forward
      model.

    - ``push``: the message is delivered to the specified recipients
      when the request for the transmission of information is initiated
      by the publisher or server platform and pushed out to the receiver
      or client application.

    - ``pull``: the message is delivered to the specified recipients
      when the request for the transmission of information is initiated
      by the receiver or client application, and then is responded by the
      publisher or server platform.  Push style requires recipients to
      register with the server platform before it can receive messages
      using this mode.

            identification of the server platform, not the identification of
            the client application itself.  An instance of a server platform
            is specific to a particular service to which client applications,
            whatever their platform (Android, iOS, Web, etc.) and therefore
            whatever their application identification, are interested in
            receiving push notifications.

            device platform:

            - Android: On Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher versions of the
              platform, a 64-bit number (expressed as a hexadecimal string), unique
              to each combination of app-signing key, user, and device.  The value
              may change if a factory reset is performed on the device or if an
              APK signing key changes.

            - iOS: The unique identifier of the iOS device, previously the
              Unique Device Identifier (UDID) of the device, which is a
              40-character string that is tied to this specific Apple device.
              It could be a SecureUDID, which is an open-source sandboxed UDID
              solution aimed at solving the main privacy issues that caused
              Apple to deprecate UDIDs.

        :param device_token: A token that identifies the device by the push
            notification provider of the device platform.

            - Android: A token identifying the device to push the notification to,
              i.e., the registration ID.  A device token is an opaque identifier
              of a device that Android Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) gives to the
              device when it first connects with it.  The device shares the device
              token with its provider.  The device token is analogous to a phone
              number; it contains information that enables GCM to locate the device
              on which the client application is installed.  GCM also uses it to
              authenticate the routing of a notification.

            - iOS: A token identifying the iOS device to push the notification to.
              A device token is an opaque identifier of a device that APNs gives to
              the device when it first connects with it.  The device shares the
              device token with its provider. Thereafter, this token accompanies
              each notification from the provider.  The device token is analogous
              to a phone number; it contains information that enables APNs to locate
              the device on which the client application is installed. APNs also
              uses it to authenticate the routing of a notification.  A device token
              is not the same thing as the device UDID returned by the
              ``uniqueIdentifier`` property of ``UIDevice``.

        :param device_platform: The platform of the end user's mobile device:

            - `ios`: Apple iOS

            - `android`: Google Android

            - `windows`: Windows Phone

        :param account_id: The identifier of the account of the user on behalf
            of whom the device is registered to receive push notification
            messages.

        :param connection: A connection to the notification database.

        :param topics: A list of keywords representing topics the end user is
            interested in to be pushed new content whenever related to one of
            those topics.  The list of supported keywords is specific to the
            publisher service of the client application and as such the

            documentation of the publisher service.

        Send a notification to the intended recipient(s) as soon as possible
        or at a given time.

        The notification and its content is stored for later delivery up to a
        maximum period of time, the lifespan of the notification, also known
        as its time-to-live(TTL).  The primary reason for this is that a
        device may be unavailable (e.g., turned off, no network coverage).


        :param app_id: The identifier of the client application that accesses
            the service.

        :param notification_type: The type of the notification to be sent, such
            as for instance `on_something_happened`.

        :param connection: A connection to the notification database.

        :param content_title: The title (first row) of the notification, in a
            standard notification.  It corresponds to the localized text that
            provides the notification’s primary description.

        :param content_text: The text (second row) of the notification, in a
            standard notification.  It corresponds to the localized text that
            provides the notification’s main content.

        :param recipient_ids: The identifier of a recipient, or a list of
            identifiers of recipients, to send the notification to.

        :param if_not_exists: Indicate whether the notification needs to be
            ignored for a particular recipient if the latter already received
            a notification of the same type that the recipient has not yet
            read.  The function doesn't check whether a previous notification
            of the same type may have a different payload.

        :param lifespan: The period of time expressed in seconds during which
            information of the notification reasonably may be expected
            usefully to inform an action or interest of the intended
            recipients.  After the lifespan expires, provision of the
            notification to the recipients may be prevented; the notification
            and its content may be deleted.  The maximum lifespan is
            ``NotificationService.MAXIMUM_LIFESPAN``.

        :param notification_mode: The mode to deliver this notification to the
            recipients.

        :param payload: Any arbitrary JSON expression added by the sender to
            provide information about the context of this notification.

        :param sender_id: The identifier of the sender on behalf whom the
            notification is sent to the recipients.

        :param schedule_time: The time when this notification needs to be sent
            to the intended recipient.  The notification is not visible to the
            intended recipient prior to this time.  If not specified, the
            notification is sent as soon as possible.

        :param recipient_timezones: A dictionary of time zones of the intended
            recipients for which the schedule time is expected to be in their
            local time.  The key corresponds to the identifier of an intended
            recipient, and the value corresponds to time zone of this
            particular recipient.

            When a time zone is defined for a particular recipient, the
            function understands that the schedule time of the notification
            for this recipient has to be converted to the local time of this
            recipient.  The function converts ``schedule_time`` to UTC, and it
            strips the time zone information to get a local time to which the
            function adds the recipient's time zone.

            For instance, if the specified schedule time is
            ``2013-12-20 15:00:00+07`` and the time zone ``+7`` is specified
            for a recipient, the schedule time is assumed to be the local time
            ``2013-12-20 08:00:00`` for the region, i.e., time zone, of this
            recipient.  The resulting schedule time with time zone for this
            recipient is then ``2013-12-20 08:00:00+07``
