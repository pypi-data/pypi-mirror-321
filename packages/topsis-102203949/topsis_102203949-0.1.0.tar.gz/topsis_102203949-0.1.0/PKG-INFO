# TOPSIS

TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a popular multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method used to evaluate and rank alternatives based on multiple criteria. It helps in selecting the best alternative by comparing each option to an ideal solution and a negative ideal solution.
