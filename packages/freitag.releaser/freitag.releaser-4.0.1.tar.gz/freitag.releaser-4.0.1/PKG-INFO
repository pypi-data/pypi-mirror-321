================
freitag.releaser
================
Release facilities to ease the management of buildout based projects.

Standing on the shoulder of giants
==================================
This distribution intends to be as small as possible by integrating a few custom release choices done by the `der Freitag`_ development team.

For that it heavily relies on a couple of well known distributions:

- `plone.releaser`_
- `zest.releaser`_

What's in?
==========
A few zest.releaser plugins that:

- check that the git repository is updated *update_git_branch*
- update development branches after a release *update_develop_branches*
- check translation files are updated *check_translations*

Additions to plone.releaser:

- ability to release a distribution within the parent (buildout) project

  - check to ensure the correct branch on the parent project is used *check_zope_branch*
  - check that the distribution about to release exists *check_folders*
  - update versions.cfg with the new released version *update_versions_cfg*

- gather the changes on distributions (more than only *collect_changelog*)
- push cfg files *publish_cfg_files*
- check which distributions need a release
- update batou version pins (components/plone/versions/versions.cfg

    ready to be released
  - i18n: runs ``bin/i18ndude find-untranslated`` and reports back if there
    are any strings not marked for translation
  - update_branches: the oposite from vcs_updated,
    rebased develop branch on top of master (which was used to make the release)

  [gforcada]

  - publish_cfg_files: send two specific files to a specific server
  - release: releases a distribution (with ``zest.releaser``)
