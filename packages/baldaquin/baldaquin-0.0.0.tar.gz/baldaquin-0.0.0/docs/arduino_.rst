:mod:`baldaquin.arduino_` --- Arduino interface
===============================================

This module provides minimal support for interacting with the Arduino ecosystem,
the basic idea is that we start with Arduino UNO and we add on more boards as we
need them.

The :class:`ArduinoBoard <baldaquin.arduino_.ArduinoBoard>` class provides a small
container encapsulating all the information we need to interact with a board, most
notably the list of (vid, pid) for the latter (that can be used to auto-detect
boards attached to a COM port), as well as the relevant parameters to upload sketches
on it.

The ``_SUPPORTED_BOARDS`` variable contains a list of boards that we support.
Additional boards can be incrementally added there.


Auto-detecting boards
---------------------

The module comes with a few utilities to help auto-detecting boards.

:meth:`board_identifiers() <baldaquin.arduino_.board_identifiers>` builds all
the ``(vid, pid)`` pairs corresponding to the :class:`ArduinoBoard <baldaquin.arduino_.ArduinoBoard>`
objects passed as an argument, e.g.,

>>> arduino_.board_identifiers(arduino_.UNO)
>>>
>>> ((0x2341, 0x0043), (0x2341, 0x0001), (0x2A03, 0x0043), (0x2341, 0x0243), (0x2341, 0x006A))

This, in turn, can be used to filter the devices connected to the COM ports in
order to auto-discover specific boards.

:meth:`identify_arduino_board() <baldaquin.arduino_.identify_arduino_board>` returns
the fully-fledged :class:`ArduinoBoard <baldaquin.arduino_.ArduinoBoard>` object
corresponding to a given (vid, pid):

>>> arduino_.identify_arduino_board(0x2341, 0x0043)
>>>
>>> ArduinoBoard(board_id='uno', name='Arduino UNO', vendor='arduino', architecture='avr',
>>> upload_protocol='arduino', upload_speed=115200, build_mcu='atmega328p',
>>> identifiers=((9025, 67), (9025, 1), (10755, 67), (9025, 579), (9025, 106)))

The two are used in conjunction with the :mod:`baldaquin.serial_` module in the
top-level interfaces
:meth:`autodetect_arduino_boards() <baldaquin.arduino_.autodetect_arduino_boards>`
and :meth:`autodetect_arduino_board() <baldaquin.arduino_.autodetect_arduino_board>`,
which can be integrated into a generic auto-detection workflow.


Uploading sketches
------------------

This module implements two diffent interfaces to programmatically upload sketches
onto a connected Arduino board:

* :class:`ArduinoCli <baldaquin.arduino_.ArduinoCli>`, wrapping the Arduino
  command-line interface;
* :class:`AvrDude <baldaquin.arduino_.AvrDude>`, wrapping avrdude.

Apparently the former is the one-stop shop, these days, for interacting programmatically
with Arduino hardware, but since it relies on the second for a lot of boards,
whether it is more convenient to use one or the other is largely a matter of what it is
easier to install.

In both cases, the basic interface for uploading pre-compiled sketches is the same

>>> ArduinoCli.upload(file_path: str, port: str, board: ArduinoBoard)
