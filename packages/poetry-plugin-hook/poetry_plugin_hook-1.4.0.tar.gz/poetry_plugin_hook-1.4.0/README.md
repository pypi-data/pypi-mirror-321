[`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) plugin to register wrapped commands to use as [`pre-commit-hooks`](https://pre-commit.com/). all hook commands return zero on success and non-zero on failure.

## install

```cmd
$ pip install poetry-plugin-hook
```

or with `poetry`

> Especially on [Windows](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#self), self commands that update or remove packages may be problematic.

```cmd
$ poetry self add poetry-plugin-hook
```

## hook bump

Extends `poetry version` command, to also bump `__version__` strings in python files.

```cmd
$ poetry hook bump --help

  Description:
    Update the version in pyproject.toml and synchronize it into files.

  Usage:
    hook bump [options] [--] [<version>]

  Arguments:
    version                    The version number or the rule to update the version.

  Options:
    -f, --file=FILE            Specify the files to update the __version__ string. [default: ["__init__.py"]] (multiple values allowed)
        --dry-run              Do not update pyproject.toml file
        --next-phase           Increment the phase of the current version
    -h, --help                 Display help for the given command. When no command is given display help for the list command.
    -q, --quiet                Do not output any message.
    -V, --version              Display this application version.
        --ansi                 Force ANSI output.
        --no-ansi              Disable ANSI output.
    -n, --no-interaction       Do not ask any interactive question.
        --no-plugins           Disables plugins.
        --no-cache             Disables Poetry source caches.
    -P, --project=PROJECT      Specify another path as the project root. All command-line arguments will be resolved relative to the current working directory.
    -C, --directory=DIRECTORY  The working directory for the Poetry command (defaults to the current working directory). All command-line arguments will be resolved relative to the given directory.
    -v|vv|vvv, --verbose       Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug.

  Help:
    Update the version from package and also bumps __version__ strings in any given file.

        poetry hook bump --next-phase patch --file __init__.py

    The new version should ideally be a valid semver string or a valid bump rule:
    patch, minor, major, prepatch, preminor, premajor, prerelease.

    If no next-phase or version is provied the version from the pyproject.toml file will be
    synced into the files.
```

## hook latest

Wrapper for `poetry show -o -T` command.

Exit code represents the number of outdated packages.

```cmd
$ poetry hook latest --help

  Description:
    Check if all top-level dependencies are up-to-date.

  Options:
        --without=WITHOUT      The dependency groups to ignore. (multiple values allowed)
        --with=WITH            The optional dependency groups to include. (multiple values allowed)
        --only=ONLY            The only dependency groups to include. (multiple values allowed)
    -l, --latest               Show the latest version. (option is always True)
    -o, --outdated             Show the latest version but only for packages that are outdated. (option is always True)
    -T, --top-level            Show only top-level dependencies. (option is always True)
    -h, --help                 Display help for the given command. When no command is given display help for the list command.
