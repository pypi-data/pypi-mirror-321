## Info
This package provides a straightforward way to detect hand gestures in a variety of videos using a combination of MediaPipe Holistic features and a convolutional neural network (CNN). We plan to update this package with better predicting network in the near future, and we plan to also make an evaluation report so that it is clear how it performs for several types of videos. For now, feel free to experiment. If your looking to just quickly generate isolate some gestures into elan, this is the package for you. Do note that annotation by rates will be much superior to this gesture coder.

The package performs:

* Feature extraction using MediaPipe Holistic (hand, body, and face features)
* Post-hoc gesture detection using a pre-trained CNN model, that I trained on SAGA, TEDM3D dataset, and the zhubo, open gesture annotated datasets.
* Automatic annotation of videos with gesture classifications
* Output generation in CSV format and ELAN-compatible files, and video labeled

Currently, the detector can identify:
- Just a general hand gesture, ("Gesture")
- Movement patterns ("Move"; this is only trained on SAGA, because these also annotated movements that were not gestures, like nose scratching); it will therefore be an unreliable category perhaps

## Installation
Consider creating a conda environment first (conda create -n envision python==3.9; conda activate envision).
```bash
conda create -n envision python==3.9
conda activate envision
(envision) pip install envisionhgdetector
```
otherwise install like this
```bash
pip install envisionhgdetector
```

Note: This package is CPU-only for wider compatibility and ease of use.

## Quick Start

```python
from envisionhgdetector import GestureDetector

# Initialize detector
detector = GestureDetector(
    motion_threshold=0.9,    # Sensitivity to motion
    gesture_threshold=0.5,   # Confidence threshold for gestures
    min_gap_s=0.1,          # Minimum gap between gestures
    min_length_s=0.1        # Minimum gesture duration
)

# Process videos
results = detector.process_folder(
    input_folder="path/to/videos",
    output_folder="path/to/output"
)

# additional processing of videos to segmented videos cut by gesture event
from envisionhgdetector import utils
segments = utils.cut_video_by_segments(outputfolder)
```

## Features

The detector uses 29 features extracted from MediaPipe Holistic, including:
- Head rotations
- Hand positions and movements
- Body landmark distances
- Normalized motion metrics

## Output

## Output

The detector generates three types of output in your specified output folder:

1. Automated Annotations (`/output/automated_annotations/`)
   - CSV files with frame-by-frame predictions
   - Contains confidence values and classifications for each frame
   - Format: `video_name_confidence_timeseries.csv`

2. ELAN Files (`/output/elan_files/`)
   - ELAN-compatible annotation files (.eaf)
   - Contains time-aligned gesture segments
   - Useful for manual verification and research purposes
   - Format: `video_name.eaf`

3. Labeled Videos (`/output/labeled_videos/`)
   - Processed videos with visual annotations
   - Shows real-time gesture detection and confidence scores
   - Useful for quick verification of detection quality
   - Format: `labeled_video_name.mp4`

## Technical Background

The package builds on previous work in gesture detection, particularly focused on using MediaPipe Holistic for comprehensive feature extraction. The CNN model is designed to handle complex temporal patterns in the extracted features.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- tensorflow-cpu
- mediapipe
- opencv-python
- numpy
- pandas
