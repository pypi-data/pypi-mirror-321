Important TODOs:
================
- Support for endianess when loading arrays directly with 'fromstring()' or
  writing them with 'tostring()'.

  Affected code:
    - rserializer.s_xt_array_double()
    - rparser.xt_array_numeric()


- The rserializer fails on objects like TaggedList([("n","Fred"), 2.0, ("c_ages", 5.5)])
  where the 2nd item has no tag name.
