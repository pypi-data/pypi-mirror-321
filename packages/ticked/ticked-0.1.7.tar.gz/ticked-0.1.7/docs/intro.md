## A terminal-based productivity suite built over [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io), designed for STEM students who need a focused work environment.


## Motivation

Most productivity applications offer too few features, leaving critical gaps for what I expect out of a productivity manager. Ticked aims to provide essential tools - task management, a pomodoro timer, Spotify integration, and note-taking/code-editing capabilities - in a single, distraction-free terminal interface.

I've explored numerous applications offering similar functionality, but they often fall short in two ways: many were created primarily as programming exercises rather than serious tools, and none of them are maintained. Ticked aims to be different - it's built with a clear purpose and a commitment to long-term development and support.

## Core Features

- Task Management with detailed insights and customization options
- Pomodoro Timer with the ability to set your own settings
- Spotify Integration via Spotipy and their Web API (Premium users only, see Spotify section for more info)
- Note-taking & Code Editing - Syntax highlighting, vim motions, autocomplete, and more features on the horizon
- Terminal-based Interface - All ran in your terminal without the need for credentials. All database data is held locally on your machine.

## Technical Background

Initially developed in C with ncurses, then migrated to Python with pycurses, Ticked found its final form using [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io) - a modern TUI framework that enables rapid development without sacrificing functionality or aesthetics. It is _insanely_ fun to develop with Textual.
