# Topsis Implementation and Python Package

This repository contains the implementation of the **Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)** as part of an assignment. It includes two components:

1. **Command-Line Python Program**  
2. **Python Package Published on PyPI**

---

## 1. Command-Line Python Program

This program calculates the TOPSIS scores and ranks for a given dataset.  

### How It Works:
- **Input File:**  
  The input file is a CSV file with three or more columns:
  - The first column contains the names of the objects/variables (e.g., M1, M2, M3, etc.).
  - The remaining columns contain numeric data.

- **Output File:**  
  The output file includes all columns from the input file with two additional columns:
  - `Topsis Score`
  - `Rank`

### Features:
- Handles exceptions for:
  - Incorrect input format.
  - Missing files.
  - Non-numeric values.
- Ensures weights and impacts are correctly formatted.
- Validates the consistency of input dimensions (number of weights, impacts, and columns).

### Usage:
Run the program through the command line:

```bash
python <program.py> <InputDataFile> <Weights> <Impacts> <ResultFileName>
```

**Example:**

```bash
python Topsis-Gazal-102217174.py data.csv "1,1,1,2" "+,+,-,+" result.csv
```

## 2. Python Package on PyPI

https://pypi.org/project/Topsis-Gazal-102217174/ 

### User Guide:
- Install the package using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install Topsis-Gazal-102217174
  ```
- Run the TOPSIS calculation from the command line:
  ```bash
  Topsis-Gazal-102217174 <InputDataFile> <Weights> <Impacts> <ResultFileName>
  ```
  **Example:**
  ```bash
  Topsis-Gazal-102217174 data.csv "1,1,1,2" "+,+,-,+" result.csv
  ```

### Testing:
The package was thoroughly tested by installing it from PyPI and running multiple test cases.
