# About SCEPY

**SCEPY** (Single-Case Experiment Python) is a Python package designed for analyzing single-case experimental data. It provides tools to efficiently prepare, analyze, and visualize single-case research designs, enabling researchers to focus on individual-level data patterns often missed in group-based analyses. 

This package is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners interested in single-case experimental methodologies, offering a streamlined workflow for generating insightful results.
