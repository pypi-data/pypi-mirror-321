    """MegaRacer is a patch on MiniRacer that allows for more memory.

    Original MiniRacer:
        MiniRacer evaluates JavaScript code using a V8 isolate.

        A MiniRacer instance can be explicitly closed using the close() method, or by using
        the MiniRacer as a context manager, i.e,:

        with MiniRacer() as mr:
            ...

        The MiniRacer instance will otherwise clean up the underlying V8 resource upon
        garbage collection.
